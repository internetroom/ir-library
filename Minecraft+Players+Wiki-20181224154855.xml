The Second Minecraftian War is a series of battles and occupations mainly shown in Quest For the Golden Monocle. The War's main reasons are unknown, but it starts with herobrine gaining the upper hand. At first the war was minor, but after uberhaxornova and The Mighty Yogscast took positions, the war became a global one. The total war lasted 75 years and was the deadliest</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2188">[[File:99th_slayer.png|thumb|340px]]99th_slayer (me) was a nobody who grew up in the slums of a large city, which recieved little or no attention, as it got common visits from creeper groups. Having large dreams to become as famous as Steve, the slayer of the Ender Dragon, he set out on an adventure, leaving the city and his life behind. After a week of traveling and evading monsters, he found a great place to build his new settlement, which is in between a jungle, a forest, and a taiga.

He has grown a great fondness of gold (which he calls &quot;butter&quot;)


==History==
(These events took place after he left the city.)



Day 1: 99th_slayer started construction of his new home.

Day 2: 99th_slayer discovered an old mine underneath his house, later making this his personal mine.

Day 8: An assassin has attacked 99th_slayer while he was gathering wood for an expansion of his home. There were no notes or orders on the assassin, he didn't even know who would want him dead, except Herobrine, of course.

Day 15: 99th_slayer was found to be a descendant of a powerful king from the golden age of Minecraft. This most likely explains why assassins have attacked him recently.

Day 17: New and strange creatures have started appearing in the plains and jungle around 99th_slayer's home, he later started investigating the new creatures.

Day 18: A guild was formed near 99th_slayer's home to help him on his way to kingship.

Day 21: The guild and the Cave of Slayers were both attacked, major damage was caused to both. The two places were fixed but another artifact has been stolen, The Chestplate of Jeb. The only lead they have on the thief is a cryptic message: &quot;The dark lord will rise up and take back what is his.&quot;

Day 43: 99th_slayer's kingdom was attacked, but not by brigands, or Reficuls, or Herobrine cultists, not even the creeper. Rather, by a dragon. Nobody knows where it came from. Part of the kingdom was decimated and many valuables from 99th_slayer's personal treasury were taken, including an heirloom that has been passed down from the first King of [[Karhia]], the province 99th_slayer lives in, to the next, and so on.

AJNLR stands for '''A'''kselHolmsted, '''J'''ordAxel, '''N'''eburenus, '''L'''asseHvillum, '''R'''edlichDK, which are the members of the group. The group was really created in 2014 when these 5 started building BlockTown, but mostly known as the group was created in 2011. The group still exists, even after almost getting disbanded in 2016 and 2017. Later the group evolved into AJNLRMOPP but AJNLR is still a group inside a group. (Drink a shot every time I say&quot;group&quot;) The members have created many things together such as BlockTown, The Deadly PVP, Minecraft City, AJNLR-huset, ColdHogCity, ColdHogTown, MobTown, BlueTown, Mobcraft and Pro-huset.

He has many friends and he spends most of his time in larger cities, even tho he lives with his friends a modern house a few kilometres from the nearest large city. He speaks both Danish and English. He rarely takes a bath since he's 50% enderman, and still doesn't smell bad for some reason. He always keeps himself away from water.

&lt;u&gt;'''HIS STORY (according to himself)'''&lt;/u&gt;

He was a normal player at first but as he were mining in 2011 he fell down into a cave with a golden ender eye. he touched it and was plagued by endermen ever since. Then one day he decided he had gotten enough so he got the idea that being a enderman for a short while and making friends with them would help. He hired a scientist to make a transformation machine. Unfortunately for him, a mouse had broken one of the wires, and he turned into half enderman, half player. And then his house exploded and he landed in RedlichDK's house with JordAxel, neburenus, and LasseHvillum. They became friends and did some stuff together. In Early 2016 he fell down into an ice cave and touched another glowing orb and turned into how he looks now. Then he did some more stuff, found his lost little brother, and started hating on roblox. And that's his story.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="806">'''Angmar,''' not to be confused with the Clan, is a cold and dark landscape, build on top of the mountains. It is a mostly abandoned and bitterly cold wasteland, the only sign of life being the harsh armies of the King amassing near the Tower of Angmar. The border of Angmar is somewhere in the beginning of the snowy mountains north of Peaceful Valley, the home in the town of RockandDirt and many other peaceful clans.

Angmar is said to be the place where the Nether and the End dimensions meet, and host inside the Overworld. The most common start of Angmar is where the flowers of the Peaceful Valley begin to wither, and the end is marked at the Sacred Jungle, at the edge of the Angmar forest.

More to come. The Watchers came to meet the blazes in battle when honeydew came.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3082">This is my story of a weird and terrifying encounter with a strange being that I had no explanation for.

I just got the 1.7.9 update which didn't add much to my Minecraft world. I had this world named King which I had started as a survival world back when I got Minecraft in 1.6.4. I was pretty fond of it because I worked on it a lot and had a 3 story house made out of spruce wood cobblestone and was redstone fuctional with ceiling lamps on every floor. I had chests full of valuables like emerald and gold and stuff like that. I was as happy as can be in my little world, until the update. I loaded by old world picking back up in a local village. I was out of emeralds so I went back to my house to get some more. I stepped inside and on the other side of the first floor stood a player with an odd skin. It was the default Steve skin with no beard but it was photo negitive . He had blue skin a red shirt and green pants with dark blue hair. All he did was stand there looking at me. I walked a bit closer and saw his name was 12470D. I was about two blocks from him when he charged me. It hit me with a 7 damage blast just from his fist. I bolted out the front door continued as it was chasing me. I had no idea what to do.

I decided to head for the village and take shelter there. I was about halfway there when the creature made a roaring sound. I looked back and there where two of them! I heard the split again and then there where three then four then five, soon I was being chased by six creepy Steve's trying to kill me. I was near the village, I could make it I would survive! I dashed inside a church and closed the door. The villagers had no interest in being friends with these strange people. They ran like there was no tomorrow. I was at the top when the Steve's broke down the door. One punched me off the side and I fell with a crunch. I had half a heart left and the Steve's came pouring down on me then I died. I hit respawn but I didn't end up next to my bed on the second floor of my house. I was somewhere very dark and black I couldn't move but I looked around then I noticed that there was someone in front of me. I turned up my brightness and saw that right in front of me was that creepy Steve named 12470D. I stared at my screen for a few seconds then my game crashed! I reloaded it again and went to my world labeled King. I was next to my bed where I should be and everything looked normal but the lights were off. That's weird I thought. But what I was more concerned about was that the creepy Steve might be in my house. I went to my chest to grab some supplies when I realized it was empty I checked some more chestes and they were all empty. Everything I owned was gone even the lights on my ceiling. I accidently hit T triggering my chat bar. Some words popped up saying: I have taken all your things. I will be back again. Sincerely, Anti-Steve.

If anyone else has a similar encounter please let me know, I want to find more info on this horrible creature![[File:IMG_20150416_171228.jpg|thumb|My version of Antisteve]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3609">Aperture Science, often shortened to just &quot;Aperture&quot; or &quot;Science,&quot; is a large company, divided into many branches. Aperture sells a variety of weapons, including potions and swords, food, and soon even more. Aperture HQ is in the center of the Aperture Science complex, in the large town of RockandDirt.
==History==
Aperture was originally a small potion shop, co-owned by Skull53 and Jose Furnace. However, tensions quickly rose, and while Skull53 was absent, Jose began to expand the company, making it more than just a potion shop. Not long after the founding, Skull53 was accused of griefing and faced banning. He quickly left Aperture, attempting to take everything with him. He failed, and a small war began.

Skull53 was quickly defeated, and Aperture forgot that it ever happened. What no one was expecting was that Jose had made an agreement, stating that if Skull was to go, all of his land was to be inherited for Aperture.

Fast forward many days, Jose has made several agreements to expand Aperture. The company was growing and began the Testing Initiative. The Testing Initiative brought many members, and the company began testing.

However, for some time the testing had to be put aside, as another conflict was rising. Some members of the new town, &quot;Acre,&quot; had complained that its mayor, Rocket, had done a terrible job at running the town had to be stopped. This tempted Jose to begin the Manifest Destiny project, in other words, killing two birds with one stone. Jose wanted to expand Aperture, while ridding or at least calming the mayor of Acre. After asking the mayor of Acre to become an Aperture town, he refused, and his new followers wanted conflict.

But Aperture had another idea. Acre had really been founded by one of Aperture's most trusted employees. They used this advantage to lock every chest in the town, sealing them off, and eventually forcing them into submission. The residents of Acre still persisted, calling themselves rebels of Aperture, and vowing to never become part of the company.

Due to the lack of resources, however, the &quot;rebels&quot; were overwhelmed without a single real conflict, and cleared out of Acre quickly. The town was then declared part of Aperture Science. This would be the end of Project Manifest Destiny for some time.

Are
==Jose Furnace Bio==
Jose Furnace was born in Aperter Eden, Minecraftia, to a paranoid man, Alfred Kazan. Kazan lived deep underground in a large cave system, constantly running from monsters like Zombies and Slimes. After years of running, he finally found a way out - into a small village. There he fell in love with Moren Kan, and Jose was born.

Jose was always a curious child. He conducted a series of experiments in his room, and, skimming over the details, blew up the entire town eventually.

Fast forward many years, Jose has forgotten about his family and town and has moved to the growing town of RockandDirt. There, he opens the small potion shop, Aperture Brewing. The shop brings in money, but Jose still craved success. He opened Aperture Science and hired dozens of trained employees, some of the most trusted being David and Jeremiah Garland, always by his side.

The company began the Testing Initiative, which included the  construction of hundreds of Iron Golems, most of which were sold, and the experimenting of human test subjects, raking in too much money to count. Some time later, Jose falls deathly ill thanks to the secret excavation of Lapis Lazuli, which would be melted into Aperture gel,

Proving to be pure poison.

To be continued when the future unfolds.

      </contributor>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5054">The faction Archangels, was a faction on SquadServers. A server once played by NoahCraftFTW. The Archangels had very few allies and truces as they were known as the 'Trash-talking' faction. They made up for it in numbers of faction members. The leaders and founders were ghosthunter712 (or youtuber Twin Knights), Toxic_hunter91, and FortunateTrollz.

== '''Birth''' ==

The faction Archangels was known as another name when it was created on January 6th, 2015. They were known as TheGoldenKnights. Originally ghosthunter712 was playing the server with his friend from school, he told me &quot;I honestly did not expect us to get as popular and powerful as we did.&quot;

== '''Betrayals''' ==

On February 1st, 2015 the TGK were first betrayed by Ronin98 and Toxic_hunter91 over a matter of which no one knows why. Leaving ghosthunter712 , xbulletnurheadx, and FortunateTrollz to pick up what was left. Which was nothing. Ghost vowed vengeance.

On March 28th, 2015 the Archangels were betrayed by Emperor, Eagles1434 when the player blew up the new Archangel battle arena they would have used to test possible new recruits because the owner blew up the one Eagles made.

On March 30th the Archangels suffer their biggest it yet, a betrayal by Co-Owner itstaylor_forrester, and officers Santiverse, generalsparkalz, EliteZeroBlade, and members Kaitlyn, Procool, and Blake123bossman. Which led to such a rage by ghosthunter712 he disbanded. He vowed to never stop raiding the traitors.

== '''Revenge''' ==

On February 10th, 2015 three members of RangersOrder, ghost, xbulletnurheadx, and new member Taylor_Forrester, assault the ex-founder's base. After watching the footage I must admit they suck at cannons. The aftermath is a poor excuse of a destroyed base but it fits the boot.

On March 31st, 2015, also known as Retribution day by ex Archangels now, the very next day after the great betrayal, ghost and his faction &quot;Exodus&quot; retaliated hard, with their entire faction online, they struck at the impostor &quot;Archangels&quot; as they stole the name, soon ghosthunter712 would make a deal and get the faction name back. The Exodus faction struck the base and got back all the loot from ghosthunter712's vault, but instead of him taking it all back he saw the flaw in his power-hungry greed so he said to his members &quot;Take all that you wish my brethren! You earned it for your devotion!&quot; As his faction were raiding the enemy base he called his Ex Co-Owner Taylor to gloat, &quot;even if you are in the base you can't raid the chests!&quot; They broke the last chest 40-45 minutes later. WIthin the weeks following ghost took it upon himself to destroy every last base 'Redemption', Taylor's new faction, had which he did as well. I asked him how he felt about it, he said &quot;I don't regret absolutely destroying my friends' bases.&quot;

== The Sad Down-Fall ==

A few days before May 16, 2015 fake evidence of ghosthunter712 fly hacking was 'approved by owner Yondie for a one month ban, which was long enough to get the faction disbanded due to owner inactivity. Luckily two days before the faction would have been disbanded after pleads to staff to reconsider and/or shorten the ban, the server under-went maintenance and did a complete reset. Some believe it was reset due to a deal between the owner of the server and an unknown supporter of the Archangels. The picture had an obvious fault as to why the IGN (in-game-name) was not in the picture. On August 12th, 2015 Taylor_Forrester admitted that the picture was forged on another server in which Kaitlyn flew up in the air and Taylor did F3 which takes names away and screenshot with Kailtyn wearing Ghost's skin.

== The Rise From The Ashes ==
On November 23rd, 2015, ghost posted a video titled 'Factions Promo', which in it was revealed that his faction name had been changed to Archangels. Signifying that his faction is back from their months of honing their abilities and preparing for the release of Misuto, which is SquadServers revamped.

AwesomeA321 (Also known by other titles, most commonly &quot;Dirtman,&quot; who is a man made of ALL dirt and is very fond of cookies) is very friendly and loves to help. He can be serious if people need him to be, but he is usually comedic, angry, or even sometimes neurotic.

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;{{Infobox |Box title = AwesomeA321|image = File:New.png|imagewidth = 200px|caption = AwesomeA321 |Row 1 title = Real Name|Row 1 info = ???|Row 2 title = Minecraft Name|Row 2 info = AwesomeA321|Row 3 title = Occupation|Row 3 info = Wikian, Gamer, Minecraftian, Last Descendant of the Dirt Family (DirtMan)|Row 4 title = Nationality|Row 4 info = ???|Row 5 title = Known for|Row 5 info = Slaying the Monster Cookie, leaving a random trail behind, being derpish}}&lt;/p&gt;
==Appearance==
AwesomeA321 has no specific appearance, but he usually has a skin portraying of his personalities. He often wears his human skin (shown in box).

==Origin==
==='''AwesomeA321'''===
AwesomeA321 is a builder. He'd rather spend his time gathering supplies and building than killing other players and mobs. AwesomeA321 found out about Minecraft through YouTube. He loved the idea of a modern indie game based off the old-fashioned &quot;retro&quot; style. Upon the summer of 2012, he officially owned the game. Since he had seen so many videos, he had already known what to do. he soon created the [[The Crusaders|Crusaders]] on a server known once as &quot;DraftCraft.&quot; They were soon destroyed and he ended up migrating over to the server, &quot;OlexCraft,&quot; after DraftCraft closed down. He joined and had much fun, but then it closed down only to soon be remade into &quot;[http://jostle.enjin.com/ JostleCraft].&quot; He can be found usually on that server, or &quot;[http://reyescraft.enjin.com/ ReyesCraft],&quot; a popular PVP server owned by a player from OlexCraft, AlReyesSpark.
==='''DirtMan'''===
DirtMan was AwesomeA321's first hand-made skin. He was supposedly born in dirt, and was formed with grass and, obviously, dirt. He was a very popular baby amongst his people, but they soon disappeared for an unknown reason. DirtMan and his family had moved to a village far from the Dirt-Walker colony (his people) when their disappearance happened, though his family was not affected. They ended up just living on and leaving behind their past. Dirtman soon grew up, and went out into the world of Minecraft to live on his own, and soon became the last of the DirtWalkers. He also encountered a [[Monster Cookie|Giant Cookie]], but that's another story. He seems to be at a young age (in his teens), and acts like any human Minecrafter would.
==='''Homeless Chuck'''===
Homeless Chuck is yet to be seen. He is one of AwesomeA321's personalities and was recently discovered. He is a mooch, and is very unintelligent. He wastes supplies, which may be why he is homeless. He is also very lazy, and would rather have others do his bidding. Chuck is very messy. Some say Chuck was born in a swamp biome, and that's why. Others believe he was once a fine, handsome, friendly, rich young man who let himself go and lost all his money after wasting his supplies and destroying his house in a freak accident.

==Servers==
*He was a mod on DraftCraft PVP and could be commonly found there before it was closed down.
*He liked to go onto OlexCraft, but lived in a large 5-story shack on an island far from spawn. Then he moved to a small mansion closer to spawn made up mostly natural materials.
*He travels from server to server and could be viewed as a somewhat nomadic player when it comes to housing on some servers.
*He is usually seen with his friends from servers he plays on the most.
==Trivia==
*DirtMan has an alternate superhero identity, but it is easy to recognize him, as he only wears a mask and a cape.
*He is very festive and loves holidays.
*He is somewhat skilled in combat against mobs, but is horrible at PVP
*DirtMan has a cousin who is human named Rocket_93.
*DirtMan does NOT have a German accent, contrary to Rocket_93's story on his page.
*Homeless Chuck has yet to be seen by anyone, not even AwesomeA321 has seen him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1012">==Description and Origin==
The original Skin Shop was made by AwesomeA321, but was a traveling business. But, after it becoming more and more popular, Awesome decided to make it a store. He built the store on the outskirts of a large town. It is larger than other buildings in the town and is very popular among the villagers. Players come from far and wide, just to get a skin, and/or to see the building.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="822">Axe48 is a deceased famed moderator, known to everyone as to never break the rules. The death of his friend Light Hordes motivated Axe to always strive to take down griefers and griefer organizations. Axe48's weapon was an iron axe.

== Death ==
In time, Axe48 started investigating the griefer organization known as [[LAVA]]. Eventually, after 5 years of investigating, Axe48 discovered the identities of the elders and planned to expose them. However, head LAVA elder [[NyanCat]], aware of what Axe48 planned to do, contracted mercenary [[Mace Sword]] to kill him. Mace first killed his guards with his diamond bow, then infiltrated his house. Axe attempted to fight back, but thanks to his enchantments, Mace quickly gained the upper hand and killed him with his emerald sword.

'''aka Axe_identprone'''



The Story Of The MCA.

A Leader of many, and conqueror of Servers Axe_identprone should be feared by all. Many Servers of which shall not be mentioned have fallen to his might. But before I get into that, let me tell you a story about him.

Axe (Axe-identprone) started out as a hacker... that's right, a hacker! Using clients for domination, it worked for along time as he tried to dominate a HUGE server, but all it took was for him to get caught and that was it, banned... and he never turned back to his old ways. He joined faction servers and joined clans such as 'Vikings' 'Assassins' and 'Red', 3 of the biggest factions on the big servers. While at each of these factions he watched them fall, and as they fell he ran... Eventually he thought it was time he made his own army, to dominate all of Minecraftia, the MineCraft Army...

The MineCraft Army (Or MCA) Grew quickly, first it was just a little hut but in a matter of days it was a town with a stone walls! A bridge grew to a town sized farm which had a bridge to a massive watchtower, quickly the MCA became the biggest faction on the server. But the faction seemed to have no problems, fending if attack after attack with ease, then it came.. the former biggest faction on the server... They had never lost a battle, but neither had the MCA, and both factions wanted to keep that title.

There was only one problem, the MCA had its army, its workers (miners, farmers etc.) and then its villagers. Where the other faction were ALL the army... The MCA were not going to win, Its villagers died first,. they should no change, and the miners didn't kill enough to make a difference before they were eliminated, and even with the army killing at least 2 for every death, they were so heavily outnumbered that it hardly made a dint on the other faction.

Eventually the MCA went into hiding, all apart from axe_identprone and his 2nd in command who had blown up the bridge and flooded the rest of the remaining bridge with lava, he hid in the only remaining part of the MCA, the top part of the watchtower, still floating... Over days they rebuilt a bottom onto the tower and dug down, and down, and down, and down... and built a tomb.

Axes tomb is still there to this day, he killed himself in that tomb, after making a secret escape route for his still surviving second in command, he killed himself in that tomb... Well that's what people think, in fact I can still I tell you he lives on... on many different servers... So if you see him tell him you want to join the MCA, because that's what hes rebuilding, on many, many different servers... For the best of Minecraftia!

Beak feather is a smuggler of ingots, armour and weapons in the skull server

== History ==
Beak feather was born in Cobbleville, a small village that was poor and the men  in the village were either fishermen or farmers and the women would usually look after the house and the children. Beak lived with his parents, his younger siblings Winia and Wings. Beak, Winia and Wings were very close. Beak and his family had a happy life until one day, when Beak was 11, skull moderators, led by Mylos Gorz, attacked Cobbleville and massacred everyone. Beak's father barricaded the door, but the skull moderators were able to barge through the door. Mylos then murdered Beak's parents in front of Beak, Winia and Wings. Beak, Wings and Winia were three of the few the survivors, though Winia, who was 7, was paralysed after an arrow hit Winia's spine. Beak, Wings and Winia were raised in an orphanage in Skull city, the capital city of the skull server. Traumatized by the death of his parents, Beak never forgot Mylos, and hoped one day to kill him.

== Smuggler life ==

At age 20, Beak became a smuggler, smuggling things from iron, diamond, gold and emerald ingots to weapons such as swords and bows. Beak would smuggle ingots by storing them in custom made storage eggs called smuggling eggs, which look like regular eggs and he would smuggle armour and weapons in hidden chests. When Beak wasn't smuggling stuff, Beak was looking after Winia, who was confined to a bed in a small apartment. Beak's smuggling partner was Wings, who had a wife and a son called Sparkles.[[Category:Players]][[Category:Stories]]</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1396">Bkpike(me) was just a lonely person until he found out he had a skill, finding mine shafts. He had no friends till a lad named sedric59 joined him on his mining trip. (sedric59 didn't know anything bout minecraft) He and Sedric talked on and on. Finally Bkpike got to be friends with Sedric. Bkpike is mostly found on 3 servers: Nytecraft, Yinland, and Craftsnow. He has a fondness for iron saying it's not the best not the worst just like meh. Not much is known about his childhood but he claims to be an orphan living alone. He soon became aware of a dragon being spotted and he started his adventure along with Sedric. They went though the entire game until the fight happened. Sedric didn't know bout ender crystals and punched one. He didn't die from explosion he died from fall damage. That's when Bkpike slain the dragon and became a hero(at least in his mind)! He died of minecraft when he fought to save his people from Herobrine's attacks. But it was all fake bkpike never did die and he got back up and shoved a stick yes a STICK in herobrine to slay him. He is know currently found creating his own world with the seed of you guessed it: bkpike. Bkpike is now BANNED in nytecraft and wont be spotted their :( but he is mostly on yinland.

Hi,I'm Blackmagemurder,and I have BEAST servers.I wanna post a pic
of mah skin which is called Ice Mage,and I wanna give credit to the guy who made it.It's the only skin I've worn besides the default.

&lt;poll&gt;
Do you think I should change my skin?
Yes
No
&lt;/poll&gt;

Servers:

My main server is called Skypo. (I just copied the name from my friend since I have trouble coming up with them). I admit my house on it is small for a guy who enchanted all his tools, weapons, and armor which are all diamond except for the bow. I currently have a farm with melons, wheat, cows, and chickens. I have a minecart track to my treehouse in the jungle part while my house is in the winter part. I died 2 times on accident. My first death was when I suffocated in my bed
when I woke up. The second is when I was fishing from my treehouse then I fell
and died.

This isn't done.

Blueprint4 is a Minecraft player, he started playing Minecraft between 2011 - 2012. Blue likes other games such as Halo, Star wars and Dragon Ball Z. Not much is known about Blue's past since some posts were lost and deleted due to updates and him just not wanting people invading his privacy. Blueprint loves Hunger Games, but hates mini games, he thinks they are ruining some of Minecraft, he wishes Minecraft could be what it was like 2 years ago, which was a simple server, simple little games like Hunger Games, factions and survival.

==History==

Blueprint4 started Minecraft in 2011 when 1.8.1 was out, Blue was just a simple noob back then with a default skin like everyone starts off as. The very first server Blue joined was &quot;Boom Craft&quot;. Blueprint4 is well known on his &lt;span style=&quot;color:rgb(68,68,68);font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:16px;&quot;&gt;favourite&lt;/span&gt; server &quot;ProjectxCraft.com&quot;. Here are a bunch of servers he has joined and left:

Duncsweb: Left

Mikeland survival: Left

Projectxcraft: Left

McPvP: Left

Blue has left all, right now he is working his way to become a server owner.

==Gen0zTeam==
Gen0zTeam is a team Blue made up in 2012, it's first name was &quot;Team Revolution&quot; created in 2011, one of the first members &quot;Nagapie&quot; suggested a name: &quot;Team exstreme&quot; but being leader Blue did not like it and kept it &quot;Team Revolution&quot;. In 2012 Blue thought as &quot;Team Revolution&quot; a griefing client, for 2 years Blue thought for a long time, do I want my team to be a griefing team like &quot;Team avo&quot;? At the end of 2012 Blue came up with &quot;Gen0zTeam&quot;, and it's stayed that way ever since, and it was decided Gen0zTeam would not be a griefing team it would be a friendly team like Sky's &quot;Team crafted&quot;.

'''&quot;Old days&quot;'''

The old days, mentioned in History, are what Blue sees as the &quot;good days&quot;, since everything has changed with all the minigames, back in 2011 - 2012, Minecraft was about building, and creativity, if you joined a server, it would contain building and other sorts of objectives, now days, Blue thinks mini games are the thing ruining Minecraft. If you look in google images, &quot;Minecraft 2011&quot;, you see builds and  a huge statue of two people who seem to be leaping with joy, type in 2014, it comes up with some builds, but guns and all that other modded stuff. Blue wishes someday mini games will die out and it will be back to building communities and simple things like factions and Hunger Games.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4365">'''CMHammond''' was born on the ''3rd'' of ''August 2012'', in the world of ''1.3.1''. He hasn’t been seen in a while.[[File:CMHammond 3D.png|thumb|A 3D model of his skin.]] 

On his first few days, he didn't do much; he chopped down only a few trees and mined very little stone. But as time progressed, and the sun had set, he got the hang of things and began exploring the wonderful world around him. At night he hid underground, safe from the evil that lurked above. He would only come up for food and only when he had run out. He was never lazy; he made sure to grab more than a stack of logs and never wasted a pickaxe. He had heard of this amazing world from a friend, who loved this placefire. A few months later, he began his life and embarked on an extraordinary journey.

His first base was underground, a place with easy access to cobblestone and ores. It took a while, but eventually, he had mined his first diamond. At this time redstone was still a strange red ore, rarer than iron, that took ages to mine with an ordinary stone pickaxe and never dropping a single item.

He never spent much time alone though, he explored other worlds too, inhabited by lots of people he had never met before. He marvelled at the amazing creations these players had made, from castles and arenas to skyships and cities! But the world of ''Minecraft ''wasn't a paradise, there were players greedy and stupid. People like this would find a way to his base and destroy everything and take his hard-earned resources, he didn't like that. Outside of the spawn area wasn't somewhere you wanted to live, there were stray items, exploded houses everywhere and people getting murdered all around you.

When he was alone, things were different, you couldn't just say ''/home ''and be teleported home, you would have to walk. Anything you wanted, you would have to find and mine, instead of buying things in a shop.

It had been nearly 3 months before '''CMHammond '''had started to use redstone. By then, a new, mysterious block had been added, only available to the gods who had access to all blocks and items that could be found in the game and could fly around the world, avoiding attacks from the monsters below. [[File:Wireless Redstone.png|thumb|Back before the /scoreboard feature, wireless redstone was only available through this glitch. It worked by updating the block via shooting an arrow or looking at a glass pane or iron bars. When you did this, the glass pane/iron bars under the boat would change in size and the boat would fall and activate a pressure plate.]]He started with simple contraptions like opening doors and turning on lights. At this time, wireless redstone was just a glitch that only worked in a short radius and involved boats, pistons and an arrow. Soon he was creating all sorts of traps and piston doors, redstone became a real hobby.

==Multiplayer==
'''CMHammond''' is the owner of the faction''' ILLUSION, '''a faction that exists on many servers. The description always reads: &quot;''We are figments of your imagination, your mind playing tricks on you.''&quot; [https://www.facebook.com/IllusionMinecraftFaction Old Facebook page]
ILLUSION hasn’t been active in quite some time now. 

He also owned a server called '''ChronoCraft'''. Unfortunately, the server was never finished or released to the public.

==Skin==
After an about a year, '''CMHammond''''s appearance changed; he began to wear more clothing. He started off with a bare chest, then with a tuxedo, then a santa suit and at last his current skin.

&lt;gallery type=&quot;slider&quot;&gt;
Before 1.8.png|Before 1.8|link=http://postimg.org/image/g53z2eyk7/|linktext=The fourth in the series, CMHammond's skin was made from scratch.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

(Images of other skins are currently unavailable)

[[File:MinecraftBoughtGames.png|thumb|400px|He currently exists in the PC version, Xbox 360 Edition, iOS Pocket Edition and Android Pocket Edition.]]

==Note==
Hi, I’m '''CMHammond'''. I haven’t played ''Minecraft'' in quite a while now, I suppose I’ve grown disinterested in it now that I’m older. Maybe I will return to it again some day.

He is currently the leader of the [[The Brethren Coast|Brethren Coast]] on MCNations. He also founded [[The Brotherhood of the Golden Pants]] on Minedlands. He was formerly the leader and co-founder of [[Team Piston]], member of [[Savica]]n Parliament and Captain of [[The Black Warrior]] on [[GabeWorld]]. He was also an officer in the [[Templars (Faction)|Templars]] on the Elitecraft server.
==Appearance==
Cannonwalker's skin is currently a caucasian man with black hair and a black beard. He wears a white shirt, blue unbuttoned vest, brown pants, and black boots with a golden trim. The skin is intended to represent his character from the former Disney MMO &quot;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_Online Pirates of the Caribbean Online].&quot;
==Biography==
===The Beginning===
Cannonwalker was originally spawned on an island in the middle of the ocean sometime during Minecraft 1.7.5. The first thing he did was break the blocks of a nearby tree, use them to make a crafting table, crafted himself a boat and went sailing. Within almost no time, Richard landed on the shores of a place known as GabeWorld. GabeWorld was ruled by a patriarch known as OMG_GABRIEL (although his friends referred to him as &quot;Hooky&quot;), along with his personally-selected administrators to see over the lands when he couldn't. Cannonwalker met many new people when he arrived: [[Parax|BaronVonShush]], [[Rocket 93]], [[Jeremiah Garland|Captain_Naughty]], [[DAVESDAVY]], [[AwesomeA321]], [[AlReyesSpark]], [[Funnyguy651]] and [[Andrew &quot;Petrova&quot; Mallace|Dirty_Mallace]]. He felt content in GabeWorld and decided to begin construction on a ship.

Cannonwalker immediately gathered wood around a coastal area in order to begin construction on a ship. One of Gabe's administrators, known as &quot;Kazuma,&quot; saw that Cannonwalker was struggling to construct the ship entirely by himself. Kazuma decided to lend Cannonwalker a helping hand, which allowed for the ship to be completed in much less time. Cannonwalker then went on and christened his new vessel &quot;The Black Warrior.&quot;&lt;gallery type=&quot;slideshow&quot; position=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

Coincidentally, Cannonwalker's ship was built off of the coast of a small town. This town was inhabited by Rocket_93, BaronVonShush, Captain_Naughty, and Squirto19. After showing interest in joining the town, Cannonwalker was admitted and given the job of dock watcher. Rocket_93 explained that the town worked on a parliamentary system in which the meetings took place in a particular room built on the second level of the town. All bills would be submitted into a chest located in the room and all proposals would be discussed as quickly as possible. One of said proposals ended up naming the town &quot;Savica.&quot;
As Cannonwalker became more involved with Savica, he began forming a bond with BaronVonShush. BaronVonShush, much to the knowledge of Cannonwalker and everybody else, was one of the richest men in GabeWorld. Cannonwalker was curious as to why this was, so Baron showed him his secret; a nether wart farm located in the Nether. Baron said that nether warts were very valuable and that one could make a lot of money harvesting and selling them.

Cannonwalker showed interest in starting a nether wart farm of his own. Following Baron's advice, Cannonwalker placed soul sand in the hull of his ship. Baron supplied Cannonwalker with a few nether warts to begin his farm which eventually evolved into a large operation, gaining about sixteen stacks (0r $300,000) per harvest. By the time GabeWorld was destroyed, Cannonwalker had nearly $3,000,000 from the nether wart business.
One night on GabeWorld, Cannonwalker and AwesomeA321 were feeling particularly bored. Cannonwalker decided to change his skin to a skin of Marshal Bowdrie, one of the two [http://thecreatures.wikia.com/wiki/The_Bowdrie_Brothers Bowdrie Brothers], that he had found earlier that day. Awesome, knowing what the skin was of, decided to change his skin to a skin of Chip Bowdrie. The two would spend the rest of the night roleplaying as Chip and Marshal.

''&lt;gallery type=&quot;slideshow&quot;&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;''

Partway through the roleplaying, Cannonwalker and Awesome decided that they should build a home of some kind and perhaps continue the roleplaying at some other time. The building was originally intended to be a small house, but slowly changed. Although the two never roleplayed as Chip and Marshal again for extended periods of time, the tower remained and was added to every so often. By the end of GabeWorld's lifetime, the tower soared just above the clouds and was still under construction.

After Cannonwalker had settled with the nether wart business and his position in Savica, he decided that it may be an interesting enterprise to try and see how far he could get in dominating GabeWorld's economy (knowing full well that he couldn't even get close). Cannonwalker teamed up with his friend, AwesomeA321, to form &quot;[[Team Piston]].&quot; Their sea headquarters was the Black Warrior (more specifically, the captain's quarters). However they would later build a land headquarters underneath Savica (actually powered by pistons, unlike the ship), much to the ignorance of Rocket_93. BaronVonShush and Captain_Naughty would also eventually join Team Piston. In the end, however, Team Piston would never realize their goal of economic domination due to the properties of GabeWorld economics.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Due to issues out of his control, Cannonwalker was forced away from GabeWorld for about ten days. When he returned, he was informed by his friends that GabeWorld had been shut down. This began Cannonwalker's quest for a new server.
===Adventuring to Simpler Lands===

After the destruction of GabeWorld, Cannonwalker and his friends were faced with the challenge of finding a new home. Cannonwalker searched for many days, trying to find a new server, until he stumbled across a vanilla survival server. This place was called &quot;Minedlands.&quot; Cannonwalker, Captain_Naughty, Rocket_93 and Squirto19 all went out into the forest biome together from Minedlands' spawn point.

After searching for an uninhabited area for about a day, Cannonwalker and Naughty came across a small abandoned room built into the side of a mountain right next to the ocean. With AwesomeA321, who tagged along sometime after, and Squirto19 by their side, they temporarily settled into this place. However, when they had gathered enough supplies to continue the journey across the ocean the group. 

The group decided to split up while traversing the ocean and notify each other of any interesting land plots they could settle on. Cannonwalker ended up finding [[The Island (Minedlands)|a small archipellago of three islands]], on which the group settled. Baron, Rocket, and The_Goldtimbers joined the group shortly afterwards, helping them connect the archipellago with dirt in order to make one large island. However, after the group began constructing on the island Cannonwalker decided he no longer wanted to be a part of the project.

One night while Cannonwalker was still a part of the Island, he killed a zombie trying to invade from the water and receivied a pair of golden armor pants from it. Cannonwalker decided that when he migrated elsewhere, the golden pants would be reverred in this new home as a symbol (of what, nobody else knows). AwesomeA321 showed interest in joining Cannonwalker, which is how the Brotherhood of the Golden Pants was originally formed.

&lt;gallery type=&quot;slideshow&quot;&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Cannonwalker sailed away from the island until eventually he found a very small island. He burrowed down below the surface and began making an area for his society underneath the island, then covering the island itself with trees. Eventually Captain_Naughty joined up with Awesome and Cannonwalker in their Brotherhood society, which resulted in the discovery of an abandoned mineshaft directly below the area and general success for the Brotherhood.
Some time after Cannonwalker's initial migration away from the Island, Captain_Naughty himself migrated away to make a new settlement (although he always kept a homepoint on the Island). Naughty told Cannonwalker of his intentions to make a Nordic-themed village far from the Island. After completing the first building, Naughty invited Cannonwalker to come see his progress. Cannonwalker travelled for a long time by sea until eventually he reached the area; an elevated grass area surrounded by mountains, taiga, and woodlands. Naughty and Cannonwalker decided to call the village &quot;Windforth,&quot; and continued on its construction.
===Joining the Templars===

After a while in Minedlands, Cannonwalker was informed of the existence of a secret society by Captain_Naughty, who also happened to be a member. Naughty told Cannonwalker that they had a secret base in a place called &quot;Elitecraft&quot; that they had been working on for the past week or so and that Cannonwalker should come join them. Cannonwalker, interested in this opportunity, went with Naughty to the realm of Elitecraft to join the Templars.

Once Cannonwalker got there, he first noticed that many of his friends from GabeWorld and Minedlands were also members: Dirty_Mallace, The_Goldtimbers, AwesomeA321, BaronVonShush, and DAVESDAVY (and AlReyesSpark later on). Cannonwalker also saw a face he hadn't seen before: ViceroyRobert. The group was welcoming upon his arrival and, since they had an abundance of supplies, provided him with diamond armor and a diamond sword.

Cannonwalker was witness to many aspects of the Templars that made them possibly the strongest faction in Elitecraft. Their extremely tall tower made it difficult for enemies to get in and their experienced members made the Templars a feared foe in combat. The Templars constantly raided enemy factions' land and stole their possessions. By June 12, the amount of Elitecraft factions the Templars had raided stood at six: Rackcity, Renegade, Homies, NFL, DeathWolf, and SteelWing. However, there was a foe in Elitecraft that stood as a challenge for the Templars.&lt;gallery type=&quot;slideshow&quot; position=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

2014-06-16_21.44.29.png|A momento from Entendre's June 12 invasion (Legenzeryfuries' Sword)
&lt;/gallery&gt;
On June 12, an Elitecraft faction known only as &quot;Entendre&quot; built a TNT cannon outside of the Templars Tower. Cannonwalker was told that Entendre had done something like this before, but the damage wasn't too bad. Legenzeryfuries, a member of Entendre, led the charge. At first the Templars didn't think Entendre's attack was anything that couldn't be fixed, but their minds were quickly changed.

Entendre began bombarding the Templars Tower with their TNT cannons, and this time they were actually able to infiltrate the tower. ViceroyRobert began gathering up the supplies in the base, saying that Entendre had set homepoints inside of the base and that there was no way to fix their problem. However, Captain_Naughty was determined to stay in the base; Cannonwalker supported Naughty's position. DAVESDAVY stated that he would stay in the tower as long as he could, but he wanted to move supplies elsewhere. 

After over an hour, the Templars were getting weary. They constantly had to plug up holes in the tower walls from the TNT cannon, each one putting them in jeopardy of being breached. However, one particular hole happened to slip their attention for a few second, which was enough time for Legenzeryfuries to slip into the base. Legenzeryfuries ran around in the base attacking all of the people on the floor. One of the Templars with an invisibility potion and a diamond sword, combined with the efforts of Cannonwalker and the other Templars, made Legen exit through the hole he entered and swim away.

As the tides started to turn and the Templars seemed to be getting the upper hand over the invaders, Elitecraft had to shut down for maintenace due to issues with the system. However, when it came back to &quot;working order&quot; the factions system was broken. Cannonwalker and the other Templars couldn't open the chests in their base or even edit the terrain, causing them to have to search for other places to play on.
On the eve of June 14, Captain_Naughty notified Cannonwalker and the other Templars that Elitecraft's faction issues had been resolved; the Templars were free to resume building. Due to the leaders of factions needing to be reassigned, Captain_Naughty re-assumed control over the Templars from ViceroyRobert. Naughty, BaronVonShush, and Cannonwalker got onto Elitecraft and began working to make the base invasion-proof; this way, Entendre and any other faction couldn't get in like they had on the 12th.

Naughty and Baron put a roof on the base and covered the tower with water. ViceroyRobert built a small obsidian bunker on top of the tower that could be exited but not entered. Cannonwalker and the others set homes in the obsidian bunker, which was then also covered in water. Cannonwalker worked on patching the holes Entendre had put in their base and was later assisted by Naughty. By the morning of June 15, the base was in better shape than ever before. As of now the Templars are digging down to bedrock to fortify the tower from underground as well; this way enemy factions, such as Entendre, can't get up through the bottom.
On the evening of June 17 (circa 7:30 PM) Cannonwalker, Dirty_Mallace, BaronVonShush and Funnyguy651 invaded the base of the Looters. The Looters was a newer faction with only two members: MicroWazzle and EZenner. Mallace originally discovered the base and called upon the Templars to help him dismantle it; Cannonwalker was the first to answer the call.

The four Templars started by repeatedly killing MicroWazzle and EZenner. Wazzle was scrambling to get all of the things in the base's chests out but the Templars proved to be too strong; Cannonwalker was able to get in one kill to each. After the base had been cleared of the two faction members Cannonwalker guarded their obsidian-covered chest room while Mallace went back to the Templars base to put things away. When Mallace returned, Cannonwalker went back to the base to do the same. The Looters then disbanded and reformed quickly, leaving the entirely base under no claim.&lt;gallery type=&quot;slideshow&quot;&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

When Cannonwalker returned, Mallace ordered the group to begin mining in the chest room so they could take the obsidian back home. After a few minutes, when all of the obsidian was mined, Mallace ordered Baron, Cannonwalker and Funnyguy to take all of the torches from the wall as well; this way, if the Looters were to return they'd come back to a surprise fight with enemy mobs. As the group was taking down the torches, Mallace stood still in shock as he discovered a surprising twist; signs around a doorway saying &quot;Entendre.&quot; This hinted at the probability of the Looters' base originally belonging to Entendre, which meant the Templars were getting closer to their revenge. Cannonalker went back to their base excited at this new discovery, knowing all the well that the Templars may soon be knocking at Entendre's front doors.
On June 18, Cannonwalker was in the Elitecraft server shop. He was looking at the prices of certain items when he came across a particular type of item; nether warts. He saw that nether warts sold for $50 for every 16 warts. He told Baron about this and suggested that the two revive their own nether wart harvesting business from GabeWorld; Baron was on board with the idea. Since the Templars tower already had an extensive nether wart farm, the two had no problem getting their start. Cannonwalker made about $6,000 on his first day and has since made over $40,000 more.
On June 22, the Templars raided the base of a faction named SLitThroat. One of the Templars' spies was sent into the SLitThroat faction, allowing them to set a home. The spy then allowed the Templars to silently teleport in. By the time Cannonwalker arrived the fighting had already begun. Dirty_Mallace, DAVESDAVY and ViceroyRobert had a SLitThroat member (seemingly the only one online) named MrCombatWaters trapped. Cannonwalker would allow [[Ned Edgewalker]] and Funnyguy651 to teleport while the Templars repeatedly killed MrCombatWaters over and over again. Cannonwalker was able to get one kill in throughout the entire commotion while also getting himself trapped in one of SLitThroat's rooms, much like Ned_Edgewalker did as well.

On June 26, Cannonwalker and ViceroyRobert devised a plan to bomb DAVESDAVY's cabin. Davy left the Templars just a few days before, taking Templar items with him. Cannonwalker provided Robert with Obsidian and TNT and, as they were nearing time to blow up the cabin, Cannonwalker decinded he didn't want to do it (at least not right then). Robert and Cannonwalker walled off the cabin with cobblestone and Cannonwalker logged off. However, this was all a part of Robert's plan.

When Cannonwalker got back on Captain_Naughty and Squirto19 told him that Davy blew up his cabin, obliterating the lower levels of the tower which required extensive repair. Naughty and Squirto also told him that they had stolen important materials and moved base, including obsidian to help construct a new base. Naughty filled in where the cabin used to be and the Templars began questioning what to do, conflicted with this issue.

On June 30, Funnyguy651 betrayed the Templars. He allowed ViceroyRobert to teleport into the base with TNT, blowing up large chunks of the base in the process and stealing/destroying all of the Templars' possessions. Cannonwalker, along with BaronVonShush and Ned_Edgewalker at first wanted to repair the base. The three, however, became disillusioned with Templar life. Cannonwalker decided to go back to his peaceful life in Minedlands, introducing Ned to the land as well.
===Return to a Simpler Place===
Cannonwalker returned to Minedlands on the evening of June 30, bringing with him BaronVonShush and Ned_Edgewalker. He found that the Brotherhood of the Golden Pants base was in as good of condition as ever and invited Baron and Ned to become members of the Brotherhood. Cannonwalker then began harvesting the overgrown trees on the island for wood and replanting. Baron arrived to the island in relatively short time, while Ned took until the next day to find his way there.&lt;gallery type=&quot;slideshow&quot; position=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

A day or so after re-arriving, Cannonwalker and Baron went to the mainland not far from the island in search of coal. The two mined many stacks of coal, while Cannonwalker also collected flowers to put around the outside of the base. Additionally, Baron said the Brotherhood should begin farming sugar cane, so he planted sugar cane around the outside edges of the island. Later on, Baron farmed in the jungle for jungle tree saplings. Cannonwalker and Baron made an artificial island not far from the original to house a jungle wood farm, this way they could plant cocoa beans to make cookies.
===Training to Become a PvP Master===
In mid-July, Cannonwalker began going to a server known only as &quot;the PPW Server;&quot; a server owned by Dirty_Mallace being administered by DAVESDAVY. On the evening of July 20, BaronVonShush, along with a few others, volunteered to help teach Cannonwalker the art of Minecraft PvP. They practiced in a small temple assembled by Baron. Cannonwalker made noteworthy progress, beating Baron a few times (all while losing most of the duels) and Mallace once (on his second try).
===The New Brood===

On the evening of July 27, 2014, Cannonwalker and four other members of Elitecraft's [[Templars (Faction)|Templars]] went to a server known as the &quot;Creatures Server.&quot; These members were [[Andrew &quot;Petrova&quot; Mallace|Dirty_Mallace/AugustPetrova]], [[Parax|BaronVonShush]], [[Ned Edgewalker]] and ViceroyRobert. ViceroyRobert founded a faction known then as &quot;TheWikians,&quot; although he soon changed it to &quot;Catalysis.&quot; Robert then left to make his own ally sister faction known as &quot;Reagent.&quot; He left Cannonwalker in charge of Catalysis.

Cannonwalker, Ned and Baron set out from spawn to find a place to set up. However, they almost immediately encountered another player's castle. The castle looked like it had been attacked by enemies, and they saw an opportunity to loot. They stole various crops, mushrooms, cobblestone, redstone, coal, and various other things from the place. They then pressed onwards.

Baron, Ned and Cannonwalker climbed up and crossed a wooden platform, which led them to a mountain. It was night time and they were beginning to get hungry, so Baron planted what little carrots they had left in a nearby pond and Cannonwalker began construction on a house. When morning was reached, Cannonwalker constructed a more permanent settlement. In the day to come, [[Rocket 93]] would also join the faction.

In the afternoon of July 28, Rocket began hoarding the New Brood's supplies in a nearby ravine. When he got everything he wanted, he left the faction and fled. Cannonwalker and Baron attempted to chase him down, but to no evail. Cannonwalker, distraught that yet another faction he was in was weakened by a traitor, gave leadership of the faction to Ned_Edgewalker and left. However, Ned convinced Cannonwalker to return. Ned, Cannonwalker and Squirto then decided to rename the faction &quot;POTCO,&quot; as &quot;TheNewBrood&quot; was only meant to be a temporary name.
===The Brethren===
In June, AlReyesSpark notified Cannonwalker of the existence of a soon-to-be Minecraft server known as &quot;MCNations.&quot; AlReyesSpark said the server was intended to be a roleplaying server where players would be a part of different nations. Cannonwalker saw this as an interesting opportunity to create a pirate nation in the Caribbean. He originally started off with a few islands in the Caribbean, but soon expanded to control much more. Cannonwalker decided to call this nation &quot;the [[The Brethren Coast|Brethren Coast]].&quot;

On August 12, a few days after the server was officially released on August 8, Cannonwalker created the Brethren Coast faction. [[Rocket 93]], [[Ned Edgewalker]], [[AwesomeA321]] and ObsidianVader joined the faction within the day, and ErixeyaOfficial is soon to join.
===Anarchy===
On August 12, ViceroyRobert notified Cannonwalker of the existence of a server known as &quot;2b2t.&quot; Robert claimed it to be the oldest known anarchy server in Minecraft. After various failed attempts at surviving on the server, Cannonwalker initially decided to give up. However, Robert captured an underground base and gave Cannonwalker the coordinates, making Cannonwalker decide to come back onto the server. By the early morning hours of August 13, Cannonwalker reached the underground base.

In the later afternoon of August 13, Robert told Cannonwalker that after such a short time, their underground base was no longer safe. They grabbed anything of value, killed all of the livestock and left. They traveled in hopes of meeting up with [[DAVESDAVY]]. After traveling thousands of blocks, Cannonwalker and Robert met up with Davy near a forted community. The three tore apart the community's wheat farm and, while Robert and Davy used the community's Nether Portal and went into the Nether, Cannonwalker remained in the overworld.

When Robert and Davy returned, it was starting to become dark. Cannonwalker built a temporary wooden base to stay in, which Robert and Davy also used. By dawn, the base was surrounded with enemies. Cannonwalker fled, while Robert and Davy died. Robert was able to retrieve his things when he respawned, but the three were split up. Cannonwalker then continued his travels away from the temporary base, setting up another with only himself when the next night arrived. During the afternoon of August 14, Cannonwalker attempted to continue his journey. However, there were multiple Endermen very close outside of his wooden bunker, so he decided to stay put for the time being.

==Territories==
*Cuba ~ Governor Squirto19
*Mount Sierra ~ No Governor
*Lakeland ~ No Governor
==Founders==
*AlReyesSpark and Squirto19

==The Founding of the Republic==

In August 2012, Caribbean Republic was formed with its only territory being Cuba. Its founders are Governor squirto19 and Leader AlReyesSpark. It has remained neutral from the days of peace and only two territories of Olexia, Fort Dirt (Independently ruled) and Cuba and survived as it expanded its small island into a functioning place to govern from.

==Expansion Age==

In the newer days as Cuba became crowded, the Republic decided it would expand to nearby of the chilly shores of Mount Sierra where it would move to its permanent capital of Frozen Los Angeles. The large city would start with just the simple mansion, skyscraper, and many underground areas to build in and remained the only city in Mount Sierra. As Frozen Los Angeles grew, so did other places, The Rise of Rock and Dirt, flourishing fast, and the Rise of Aperture Science, a large superpower. They would both be dealt with peacefully for a long while.
==Bronze Age==
As the older nation grew eventually a mall was set out to be built after the finished construction of the mayoral and governoral offices were built for Mount Sierra and Frozen Los Angeles. With a RaD Embassy keeping peace. The Republic started to arise as more joined the two founders, but did not flourish as the others did
Meanwhile, tensions rose as a new power rose, the New California Republic, that rove fear into Aperture and would eventually spark the first war the land of Olexia will have seen. As it progressed, the Republic would remain neutral through it.
==Silver Age==
With the fall of Aperture, and later NCR, the nation continued to prevail peacefully, as did their ally RaD who also decided to take a peaceful approach. The Republic would begin to expand its borders beyond that of Frozen Los Angeles and to the Bluedog Frontier, north of the city. The land between the border and the city will soon begin to be built as Mount Sierra grows, and a new territory rises, Lakeland. The Republic continues to grow as more begin to join.

*Rooftop lookout post: A simple tower made out of stone bricks, standing on 4 pillars of stone brick and which is significantly higher than other towers in the castle. It has a bed in it, too.

*Storage room: Lots of (empty) chests
*Mage's Tower: A tower with a brewing stand, a cauldron, 2 bookcases, open windows, a crafting table, a chest (with empty bottles, potions, potion ingredients, paper, books and a map of the castle), a potted Brown Mushroom and a furnace

      <comment>I decided to upload this to support my friend; Patrick also known as CattleMc to get him popularized which he can start springing up his intentions and intelligence to others.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="828">CattleMc; a skilled Pvper has been on Minecraft Since 2011, joining most Soup servers in his Pvp fiesta on December 20th, 2012.

== Kohi.US ==
During 2014 rumors spread of a new server like Badlion called Kohi, CattleMc at the time increasing his concentration on Pvp attached a fondness for the server which was still developing. 

After the course of 2 months alto of ranks were tallied and CattleMc was grafted into the best Pvper's section; CattleMc already indulged with his position went on a killing spree which was recorded by him and another player named JoeJoeFish whom had seen CattleMc being praised with a God rank on a server once named QubedPvp in 2012, not al of people know CattleMc but the vast majority of a large server known as OCGA.ME which even had PerpetualJordan play on and record on his channel daily.</text>

He lives with most of his friends in that home. He used to work on a freight Airship as the Captain. He retired when he almost crashed it into the side of Mt. Crafter. Clover has many different personalities. He was originally seen as a Cyborg creeper, but then shifted over into Smile Guy. Smile Guy was a happy man who disappeared after his Captain of the ship he was on, almost crashed it into a mountain. They could have been the same person.

==Appearance==

Smile Guy is mostly black, not to be racist, with red markings on his body. The brightest part of his skin is his eyes and teeth. He has super white teeth and half white eyes. The other half is red. 

Clover's current skin shows his armor and his shoulder pads. Under his armor is his red sweater and black pants with green bands across them. Across his chest he has a band that holds up a diamond sword on his back. He has blue eyes and brown hair with wings on the side of his head.

It was a normal peaceful little town until 1998 when entity 303 obliterated the entire town except a few players, [[AkselHolmsted]] being one of them. Cobbleville is just one of the many villages that got destroyed when entity 303 went on a killstreak in 1998, but is the biggest one. Now, it's a popular destination for tourists and explorers. 

'''Story'''

The village was founded in 1876 and slowly became a medium-sized town. But during an unknown night during 1998, entity 303 bursted out of the nearby mine. Entity 303 ran over the fields. And set fire to the town hall. I was not long before the entire city stood in flames. 5.900 people died that night. As soon as entity 303 was done with cobbleville he continued to the next town, Plankstown. Meanwhile a few lucky players made it to safety. That was when the citys TNT depot caught on fire and blew half the city up.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="822">From the destroyed buildings, ruined test chambers, and smashed paintings, rose a new clan...



[[File:Nether.jpg|left]]


==Origin==
The Combine was formed almost immediately after the fall of Aperture Science, deep under the surface of Minecraftia, below the test chambers and offices. In a time of desperation, the CEO of Aperture, Jose Furnace, fled from the conflict and into a Nether Portal. The scientists soon followed. Unfortunately, the exit portal had been smashed by a Ghast, and the scientists were forced to build a new civillization below the world. They mined tunnels of Netherrack, smelting them into a strong Nether Brick. With the Nether Brick, they began building a massive fortress and claimed it under the name of the Combine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="463">To build this door you need two sticky pistons
and the blocks of your choice.
Place the two pistons facing toward you directly on top of each other.
Then place two blocks of your choice on the sticky
part of the piston.
You will want to put the pistons and blocks so that they
are right before your door.
Place two blocks of your choice next to the pistons
and then put two switches on the blocks one above
the other. And there you are!

Creep8 was once a moderator called Iron Ace, but after 4 corrupt moderatos betrayed him, he becames Creep8

== History ==

=== As Iron Ace ===
As Iron Ace, Iron Ace was a dedicated moderator and was not afraid of testifying against corrupt moderators. Iron Ace was dedicated to the rules and was well respected. One day, while on an assignment with corrupt moderators Birdie, Mace44, Woodon and IronMan88, the 4 moderators betrayed him and beat him to near death. Ironman88 then spawned in creepers and left Iron Ace to die. The 4 then claimed he was killed by attacking creepers.

=== Becoming Creep8 ===
Iron survived, however, and after intensive gene therapy to resemble a creeper and renamed himself Creep8 and when he found out they got away with his betrayal, he vowed revenge on the 4 moderators.

=== Revenge ===
After 6 years of planning, Creep8 then proceeded to exact his revenge. Creep8 first target was Birdie by rigging his house with TNT, which Birdie set of after he stepped on a pressure plate. Mace44 was the second target and Creep8 ambushed and killed Mace44 with his diamond sword.

==AutoBiography==
Creeperandiknow or Creeper Jr. for short was born in Teirm, of the year Beta 1.2_01. He was the only human out of his creeper family. He has no brothers or sisters since King Jasper XVI had rein over the land, Creepers parents and brothers and sisters were killed by King Jasper because of treason, for giving away his secret vault of no one knows what. And so, Creeper jr. decided to hunt down King Jasper for his actions. Even though King Jasper had an army and ships with cannons to get across the Sea of Vastness he knew that Creeper Jr. would catch up to him. Why? He knew that Creeper Jr. had taken part in the MAOBAS (Minecraftia's Association Of Bows and Swords) which is an asassination group that sides itself with allies that are against the Empire of King Jasper XVI. King Jasper did not know what weapons he had mastered over at the training academy but he knew he was very skilled with a bow. So as King Jasper set sail for a forgotten island that nobody in minecraftia had ever heard of, Creeper Jr. thought of a way to hide on his boat so that he could use a sneak attack to kill the king. The king however was not a favorite of his subjects so pirates usually tried to rob him of his ships treasury which held overwhelming numbers of minecraftia's finest valuables. King Jasper made a note of this and told his sea captain who in turn told his men to be on guard and to be ready for anything

Within the series' narrative, the Cyrannomat is the original clone of [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/cyranno-kelbrid-webi.html Cyranno W. Kelbrid], the founder and builder of Jamestown, a city which appears in the [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/cobc-webi.html COBC Gaming] Minecraft gameplay series [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/planet-minecraft-webi.html Planet MInecraft]. Shortly after numerous misunderstandings, the Cyrannomat turned against it's creator, and gained so much power that it was forced to upgrade to be able to survive. In the [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/slaves-rebellion.html penultimate episode of the first season], the malicious entity morphed its memories and abilities with that of several internet stories and beings, including that of [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/tara-the-android-webi.html Tara the Android], and used its power to try to control Minecraft. ​The creator, Kelbrid, and his companion, [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/maiven-webi.html MaivenPlayz _], took it upon themselves to stop the clone before it could cause any harm.

The Cyrannomat 2018 had the ability to possess and control technologies and digital entities (such as Minecraft players). It was able to send Kelbrid to entirely different maps, teleported him through several points in the maps, and created portals that were able to do the same.

The Cyrannomat 2018 was destroyed in the [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/season-1-pm-webi.html season 1] finale [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/kelbrid-vs-the-might-of-the-cyrannomites-webi.html &quot;Kelbrid vs. the Might of the Cyrannomites&quot;].

== ​Creation ==
[https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/cyranno-kelbrid-webi.html Cyranno W. Kelbrid] created and designed the [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/cyrannomat-webi.html Cyrannomat]. Their creation is set to be explained in an episode of COBC Confidential.

== Physical Characteristics ==
The Cyrannomat 2018 retains its resemblance to its creator, [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/cyranno-kelbrid-webi.html Cyranno W. Kelbrid], from its predecessor's body, the [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/cyrannomat-2017-webi.html Cyrannomat 2017]. Despite its given title, both versions of the Cyrannomat were conceived during January 2018.

2018's appearance was first seen in [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/slaves-rebellion.html &quot;Slave's Rebellion, Part Two&quot;]. It was significantly more gory after upgrade, but did not heal. The blood could, however, be a result of the uncleaned wounds that appeared on its predecessor's body in the previous episode. Their blood wounds are thick, heavy, and light. The most easily identifiable is the thick blood wounds, which are black (or dark red) in appearance.

Furthermore, '18 is covered in some type of gray and red suit, and wears a glass helmet. The red bits in the Cyrannomat's body resemble Redstone, a mineral which the Cyrannomat heavily uses is all of its appearances.

While in close proximity of it creation, Kelbrid discovered in the story &quot;[https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/kelbrid-vs-the-might-of-the-cyrannomites-webi.html Kelbrid vs. the Might of the Cyrannomites]&quot; that you can see through the helmet to get a better view of '18's head. It's entire body is bloody, and only its hands (and a small part of a suit) are left exposed. Alternatively, clones of 2018 are not wearing their helmet, exposing their head as well. Their hair contains a bald spot partially covered in blood.

The Cyrannomat cannot be killed in normal Minecraft gameplay. It can teleport between locations, and can seem to rise when respawning after being slain.

However, in the [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/season-1-pm-webi.html season one] finale of [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/planet-minecraft-webi.html Planet Minecraft], once the Cyrannomat 2018 has accepted its ultimate fate, it's body begins to glow orange-yellow, and it's eyes begin to glow white. '18 is disintegrated when he is destroyed, and its body disappears altogether from the game.

=== Movement ===
Unlike, the [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/cyrannomat-2017-webi.html Cyrannomat 2017], the Cyrannomat 2018 does not walk or run much. However, he has a tendency to menacingly move its head and body.

Additionally, the Cyrannomat 2018 was actually not able to move sometimes due to its redstone circuitry being damaged, as explained within its series.

=== Voice ===
The Cyrannomat 2018 is voiced by [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/r-flores-webi.html R. Flores]. His voice is run through a voice editor, which greatly changes his voice. However, his new voice is not as audible as it's predecessor's, and as a result, its voice was revised, and footage of the Cyrannomat recorded previous of this was re-recorded before being re-uploaded again.

== Development ==
Information on the development and story behind the [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/cyrannomat-webi.html Cyrannomat ]is set to be explained in an episode of COBC Confidential.

== Fictional history ==
​The most disturbing episode that I’ve ever made so far. But like I said in the video: Don’t. Tell. Him.
- Kelbrid, commentating on his most recent video at the time.

=== ''Planet Minecraft'' ===

==== Creation of the original Cyrannomat ====
[https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/cyrannomat-2017-webi.html In January 2018, Kelbrid created a Minecraft player within the game], [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/cyrannomat-webi.html which cloned his appearance], in the Jamestown city map. (This map was used as the setting for the [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/cobc-webi.html COBC Gaming] Minecraft gameplay series [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/planet-minecraft-webi.html Planet Minecraft]). Kelbrid originally intended for it to be an assistant to Kelbrid, however, shortly after, it gained sentience and independence from Kelbrid. It rebelled against him and gained so much power that he was forced to update himself to survive.

==== Update into the Cyrannomat 2018 ====
The entity successfully updated himself into a newer, and bloodier, self in the penultimate episode [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/slaves-rebellion.html &quot;Slave's Rebellion, Part Two&quot;]. Although it was never officially called this in the series, this new version of the Cyrannomat was separately cataloged and titled 'Cyrannomat 2018'.

The clone's update led to a massive fire within Jamestown. Additionally, it caused the footage taken for the episode to glow extremely bright. As the footage turned orange, the Cyrannomat 'faded' appearances into the newer form seen at the end of that episode.

==== First hours ====
The only 'regular appearance' of the [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/cyrannomat-webi.html Cyrannomat ]was the season 1 finale [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/kelbrid-vs-the-might-of-the-cyrannomites-webi.html &quot;Kelbrid vs. the Might of the Cyrannomites&quot;].

The multi-part episode begins witH Kelbrid realizing that his Jamestown residence has been partially destroyed as a result of the Cyrannomat's update. Kelbrid tries to fight the newly-updated Cyrannomat but is unable to due to several factors. After he cowers in the cave system underneath the city, the Cyrannomat follows and captures him. However, despite Kelbrid being cornered, the Cyrannomat becomes unresponsive, allowing Kelbrid to kill him. He comes to the conclusion that he's malfunctioning because his house had been destroyed in a fire which Kelbrid started before the clone had updated. The house included several redstone contraptions and when the house was destoyed, Kelbrid proposes, the redstone circuitry was damaged.

The Cyrannomat continues to malfunction throughout the ordeal, only barely able to operate every once in a while. Eventually, the Cyrannomat disappears from the map altogether, leaving Kelbrid to rant about how he's truly disappointed that this epic development had ended this way.

He proceeds to end the video, but he stops when he realizes that he's been sent to an entirely different world from Jamestown. This map only features a floating platform with large boxes made from polished diorite. Inside these are many things, such as mob spawners and portals.

Kelbrid is horrified that to find that the mob spawners are filled with sword-owning creatures resembling the Cyrannomat, which would later be revealed to be called Cyrannomites. When the spawners activate without warning, Kelbrid escapes through [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/oneblock-portal-webi.html one of the above-mentioned portals], which he theorizes were built by the Cyrannomat.

The smaller attacking creatures are able to fly through blocks, and while Kelbrid is gone, they are able to spawn in larger numbers. Additionally, when Kelbrid returns, a glitched variation of the Cyrannomat is discovered.

A box containing a temple of the Cyrannomat is discovered by Kelbrid, who has by then been joined by [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/maiven-webi.html MaivenPlayz _]. When Kelbrid messes around with the temple, Maiven is psychically-attacked by Cyrannomat. As a result, Maiven starts seeing visions of [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/tara-the-android-webi.html Tara the Android], a robot which, within the stories' narrative, was built by a serial killer and managed to somehow replicate itself on the internet. The Cyrannomat appears for a short amount of time, taunting Kelbrid and Maiven, before disappearing.

Maiven slowly recovers from the 'psych-attack', and discoverers a hidden level beneath the temple. The two venture there only to discover more redstone circuitry akin to those found on Jamestown. The hidden level has a terrible ambient noise which causes Maiven to want to leave. Just before they manage to leave, the Cyrannomat appears and attacks Maiven once more. This time, 2018 is accompanied by it's predecessor, the [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/cyrannomat-2017-webi.html Cyrannomat 2017]. A horde of Cyrannomats engulf the pair as Maiven has more horrific hallucinations of Tara the Android.

Kelbrid manages to destroy the Cyrannomats and Cyrannomites, but the Cyrannomat 2018 captures and kidnaps Maiven. Kelbrid escapes to the outside world only to discover an Age of Discovery-like spacecraft hovering above the platform. Kelbrid manages to reach the spacecraft, but is devastated to discover that Maiven has been encased and converted into a Cyrannomat.

==== The Cyrannomat(s') new plan ====
The Cyrannomat 2017, the Cyrannomat 2018, and the Maiven Cyrannomat prepare to take control over Minecraft, but surviving memories of Maiven's Cyrannomat inspire the other two Cyrannomats to instead attempt to control the internet, as they know about the Deep Web and the Mariana's Web since Kelbrid had previously told Maiven about them.

'18 discovers through Maiven that the U.S. Government supposedly used the Deep Web, and theorizes that one way or another, the three Cyrannomats will be able to send their malicious consciousness onto the physical, real world.

Kelbrid contacts his previous [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/companion-webi.html companion], [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/abel-hernandez-webi.html 'Lil Abe] ([https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/abel-hernandez-webi.html Abel Hernandez], [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/cubical-universe-webi.html Cubical Universe]), to have him quickly install a phone virus into his phone. Since the Cyrannomats originate from Kelbrid's Minecraft files and app, they are trapped in Kelbrid's phone. Without access to the internet, the Cyrannomat's hijack Kelbrid's phone in order to reconnect. Abel's virus, however, prevents this, and a Kelbrid instead uses a Cyrannomat Portal (filled with advanced code) against them. Kelbrid proceeds in his plan to disable the Cyrannomats by having him perform a simple task that would render the Cyrannomats useless. The process requires Kelbrid to change any numbers above '2' to '0's or '1's. However, Kelbrid is unable to work fast enough to keep up with the Cyrannomats. As a result, the Cyrannomat's connection to the internet is restored.

Maiven is released from the control of the Cyrannomats since she has been rendered no longer necessary. However, Kelbrid realizes that Maiven had previously borrowed an approved Google Play license from Kelbrid. Kelbrid has Maiven connect to X-Box Live and allow their world to be joined by anyone in the world. Maiven and Kelbrid call every member of the [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/nixxons-alliance-webi.html Nixxon's Alliance], including Abel, [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/supertroll-webi.html Diego Reynoso] (Supertroll), and [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/mech-x-xavious-person-webi.html Mech-X-Xavious] ([https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/mech-x-xavious-channel-webi.html Mech-X-Xavious]), and have them join their server.

The increased amount of players allows the '011' task to be accomplished successfully. The Cyrannomat 2018 and Cyrannomat 2017, now permanently disconnected from the internet, are hacked and reduced to only Minecraft players once more. The Alliance work together to destroy all of the Cyrannomats duplicates and the [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/cyrannomat-2017-webi.html Cyrannomat 2017], who is revealed to have just been an 'echo in the game'.

==== Ultimate fate of the Cyrannomat and Minecraft ====
All of the members of the Alliance work together to destroy the Cyrannomat 2018, the final survivor of the Cyrannomat species. Kelbrid, Abel and Maiven create a violent explosion on the platform world which destroys the Cyrannomat 2018. However, the almost infinite virtual power of the Cyrannomat 2018 keeps him from dying immediately, and instead, the Cyrannomat 2018 burns alive for a period of one minute. The death is so traumatic to the Minecraft game and code, that it is 'replayed' or 'replicated' on every one of the Alliance's Minecraft maps. The ultimate destruction of the Cyrannomat leaves all Minecraft maps with a gigantic crater, which is later repaired with help of the Cyrannomat Portal's code.

The Alliance is relieved to hear that the Cyrannomat(s) has been succesfully destroyed, and leave Kelbrid to rebuild Jamestown.

== Appearances ==
The Cyrannomat 2018 appeared mainly in the COBC Gaming Minecraft gameplay series Planet Minecraft. However, it has been scheduled to appear in other series' or works.

==Biography==
DAVESDAVY apparently fell out of the sky, we have no idea why. He came equipped with golden armor and a diamond sword on his back. We have no clue if he fell from Heaven or just slipped off a block while he was pillaring. After the success of The Reapers he later found out the art of cloning. He began cloning Creepers then started cloning Enderdragons. The ability to clone makes him a powerful enemy to deal with. Almost every day he can be seen building up his army (Creepers, Iron Golems, Clay Soldiers, etc.) and building new structures and vehicles for their use.
==Creations==

This was built by me, the world is Vector City.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
==Factual History==
Later after this he created the faction Japan, later to be destroyed by Preference. After this incident he rebuilt Japan then proceeded to destroy the Warriors base, he succeeded, but was destroyed in response. Finally he created his current faction called, The Reapers. This was successful, as had a huge base with a fully functional mob spawner.

==Biography==
Dcomando15, an old adventurer, who bears many disguises, was born in unknown lands in the north, a land of everlasting winter. He soon travelled to a great plain, and found an ancient city called Yedikule. There, the lord of the land, tbohus, and his two advisors, rex1070 and jenright18, welcomed him to their fair city. There, he built a famous bar called Danny's Place. It served as a local inn, and a town meeting hall. After finishing construction, he and another citizen, Tama63, built the Yedikule Railway. Long before it was finished, however, a mighty fire burned the city, and it was abandoned.

Soon after abandoning it, the remaining citizens of Yedikule travelled many leagues before founding a small city under the shadow of three great mountains. Dcomando15 went into a solemn state, and travelled into the wilderness a few miles away, where he lived in peace. He abandoned his solemn home after many years, and travelled a great many leagues across the water, before a pirate known as Preference sunk his ship, and jailed him. He broke out, and was invited into the ranks of Preference's pirates for his cunning. As soon as he was set off, he ran to a nearby city governed by a Moroccan, and built a house in the hillside. After an argument with a city official, he wired TNT across the city, and set it to blow. He picked up a companion, Dirty_Mallace, and blew the city, then ran to a band of raiders. The two of them built a home, and survived there for many years, before travelling to Mistral City.

This was several years before the adventurers [[Honeydew]] and [[Xephos]] visited the city, even before Skylord_Jasper ''was'' a skylord. The duo split up, with Dirty_Mallace staying in Mistral City. Whilst in the gleaming city, dcomando15 made a friend, leonasta. They travelled many leagues to find the ancient dwarven city of Stoneholm, but could not. They, instead, took over an abandoned mansion and formed a guild, the Warriors. The mansion was destroyed later, and they moved to Skyfort Leon, a few miles from where the [[The Yogcave|Yogcave]] would be built. The skyfort, too, was destroyed, and so dcomando15 gathered his companions, and travelled to his old home, to find it in a damaged state. He founded the city of Malia, which was abandoned after the pirate Preference struck vengeance.

With furious anger, his companions and he built Sky City, an enormous, stone city levitating in the sky. That is where he resides today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1180">'''__NOEDITSECTION__DoppelX''' is a resident of Minecraftia, with expertise in both the fields of magic and science and little to no battle skill. 

==Background==

DoppelX had traveled all over the lands of Minecraftia, gaining knowledge from his experiences and developing machines that would help him in his endeavors. Over time he gained many cohorts that joined him in his travels, such as the brave pirate Squidnut and the mighty warrior JamezMF. They can typically be found transversing the lands in search of riches and anything that may be of some use them.
==Equipment==
DoppelX can typically be seen wearing his &quot;trendy&quot; red-tinted visor, which provides him with a specialized HUD for everyday exploring and a &quot;cloaking device&quot; that allows him to disguise when in trouble. He also has a pair of specialized goggles that allow him to see things others cannot, but he tends not to wear them because he believes they are not &quot;cool enough&quot; for everyday use.

==Appearance==

DoppelX is a Caucasian man with brown hair and a slowly-growing beard. He typically wears his &quot;styling&quot; lab coat and red visor, but can also be seen disguised as other players.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1727">Hello, I'm '''Dude10190'''. I create skins, make videos (don't have a YouTube lol), and host the [http://herobrinefans.forumotion.com Herobrine Fan Club] .

I will tell you about individual things
==Minecraft Business==
The things I do in Minecraft are quite simple. Create skins, make maps, play servers, make videos. I don't really make videos about Minecraft, but when I get YouTube, I will post pretty often.[[File:Dude10190.png|thumb|Me]]

Of course, in the future, I will do other things. I will make a server, start modding, and become famous slowly over time. However, I need to be focused on Minecraft to do those things. Because I can't be doing a TSA project at the same time as a Minecraft video.
===Servers===
I don't usually play on servers. But when I do, I always choose my LAN server because there's too many advanced servers that are very popular.

I should say that a server called McGlowstone, which shut down a year ago, was my very favorite. It didn't have the usual &quot;fancy&quot; atmosphere, the spawn looked nice, but it wasn't 50 miles long, and the players had a good humor.

I'm also planning on hosting a server near the end of the summer of 2014.
===Skins===
I haven't been making skins that often. I usually keeps them secret. I'm good with choosing good colors and features for the skin, but I'm not a big fan with shading. This is Minecraft, not SuperRealisticCraft.

I hate skins that look stupid and unfinished. Stupid ones, I would say, would be a reworked Steve or a teenage girl. Unfinished would be... well... I can't describe it.

==The Beginning==

It all started in 1.7 When I tamed my first wolf. I hadn't had much interest in taming wolfs, Even though I started playing around 1.3 - 1.4. I ended up finding 4 more wolfs in the forest. Luckily I had a lot of bones. Soon after that I finished my beach house. Then I found some clay and made a pet store. (Don't ask why) I put 3 dogs in there and 2 in my house. I even started a dye collection, And I got some records. Then, Well things went bad...
==A Firery Disaster==
Well, I had just gotten enough Obsidian to make a portal and I was planning on going to the nether. But being the Minecraft noob I amI put the portal right next to my beach house, Like right next to it. If you didn't know my beach house was made out of wood, so When I accidently lit it on fire everything went up in flames... Luckily I hadn't really started the process of moving my stuff in from my cave, So I only lost a bunch of dyes. Both dogs were incinerated, Or you could say cremated...

==Hello!==
I first played minecraft probably in 2010, around December. I really loved playing it, But now it only seems fun with mods or playing on multiplayer servers :(


==Peace Keepers==
The &quot;Peace Keepers&quot; were created on a Pvp Anarchy server called Destination Imagination. The Original members were Dukerownsyou1, Naughtydax, And Creeping_Boom. Other Members were Aidanrogenes, Herb_The_Hero (Betrayed us, Killed by Aidanrogenes), And Zantoes1. The Peace Keepers had three bases. One right at the spawn. One on top of a mountain by the spawn, And one that is a bit farther away. All were destroyed. All other members no longer play on the server.

It again features a his bed, bookshelf, and private chest. However, it has a painting as well. Each half has an item frame. eagle_flame369's item frame has a piece of rotten flesh in it, whilst Didimaki's item frame has an axe in it.  Each half also has a door to eather Didimaki's or eagle_flame369's private balconies. The stairs to the roof are also included.

The roof features a door to the house, and also features blocks on the top of the walls that allow Didimaki and eagle_flame369 to shoot mobs with bows in between them. There is also a lookout on top of the doorway. Other than that, there is hardly anything on the roof.

Once, I, Mctalwolfer, got attacked by a user on Minecraft called Emperor Nuxlear. he wrote with bricks that he has a wicked plan to kill Herobrine. I don't know what it is, but I suggest to be careful of it.


==His Letter==


''Dear Minecrafter,''

''My name is Emperor Nuxlear, your hero and pleasure, but also your villain and worst nightmare.''

''Sorry for frightening you, but I'm not the Herobrine, I have just come here on the way to controlling Minecraft. If you help me kill the Herobrine and take over his throne in the Nether, I shall let you survive and I wont destroy your precious world. Nuxlear Inc.''

Ender cobble is an enderman-player hybrid swordsman. His father was an enderman and his mother was a player.

== History ==

=== Early life ===
Ender Cobble was born to a player mother and an enderman father. Ender lived happily with his parents until he was 10, when endermen invdaded his home. His mother was killed on the spot by an enderman general and his father was arrested and executed by the same general. After that, Ender lived a hard life and was often seen as and outcast by other players. Ender had to steal to survive. 

=== Learning sword fighting ===
At age 13, Ender was found and taken in by a player swordsman called Jerns. Unlike the rest, Jerns was caring to Ender and raised him as his own. Jerns taught Ender swordfighting.[[Category:Players]][[Category:Stories]]</text>

A few people in town woke up to strange sounds coming from x_Steven123_x's house. A local witness named FrederikHartz says it sounded like two endermen wrestling while screaming. Steven, who lived in that house was never seen again, but security cameras in his house had recorded what happened. Steven was laying in bed, sleeping when an enderman teleported into his house and stared at him. The camera randomly went out for a few seconds and when it turned on &quot;endersteve&quot; was crawling on the floor in pain, before teleporting to the top of Gravel Mountain. In 2016, [[JordAxel]] found a few footsteps under the snow on top of Gravel Mountain. They are probably from endersteve, says ToxiCaz10, his neighbor from 2012. In 2018 an enderman with the shape of a player was spotted leaving behind something that looked like Steven's clothin, but there is no proof it's actually x_Steven123_x.

[[User:Minecraft storyteller|Minecraft storyteller]] ([[User talk:Minecraft storyteller|talk]]) 09:50, April 15, 2015 (UTC)
&lt;p&gt;I woke up at the middle of a cold taiga. I have no memory of what happened before that. But I had i felling that I need to get some wood. I have no tools, so I wanted to use my hands. I thoght it might hurt a little, ok maybe not a little. But when my hand punched the tree. It did not hurt, even a little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[[File:Minecraft1.jpg|thumb|The cold taiga biome.]]  I needed some food, after punching so..... many trees.The animals were strange. The soulless eyes watching make my every move. Killed some of them, I thoght that a dead body would appear. But it disappeered in a cloud of white smoke. It also dropped strange floating 'Items' as I would call them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used the wood I found to craft wooden planks. I compressed the planks to make a table which I can craft tools from. I called it a 'crafting table'. I tried many times to craft a wooden pickaxe. After some time, i finally crafted a wooden pickaxe.It is alreddy noon when i crafted the pickaxe.i dug the dirt using my bare hands. I found some stone and started to mine it. I hope I can find some things that can be made into torchs. Tried it with wood, did not last for a hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mined until it is almost sunset. I only get 35 cobblestone. I made a house quickly, I had a very bad feeling that something would get me if do not bulid a house in time. I crafted torches and place them in my house. Later, I heard the sounds of the 'mobs' wandering near my house. I have no place to sleep, so I better wait the night out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is sunrise, i can hear the mobs burning. I went out of my house, hoping to find anything new in this world. I came across a large cave.I finally saw the mobs. The green human-like mob is called a zombie. The mess of bones is a skeleton. The crawing black-brown mob with red eyes is a spider. I wish I can see new mobs that I can try to kill. I went back to my house. Crafted me a stone pickaxe, which is as same as the wooden pickaxe. Only I chaged the wood into cobblestone. I also crafted a sword. I went back to the cave, used my sword to slay them all.The spider droped thin but strong string and also its eye. Zombies drop flesh which smells nasty. It is rotten flesh. Skeletons drop bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used my new pickaxe to mine more coal and I found a new ore. I mined it and it gave me the ore, unlike coal. I went back home, thinking how to smelt it. Thats it! I can craft a place where I can smelt or cook items. I smelted the new ore, got a shiny item. I named it 'iron' because it sounds cool &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text>

Hi other miners, this is evan7829, and I have played minecraft faithfully for many years. I like to mine more than anything, and can be found in many different servers. To tell you the truth, I am a total griefer, so don't let me have a diamond pick or axe in your house! I am a demon, but I slide a steve face over my head at all times, so be careful when you're all alone at night...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1545">[[File:Xcalibur.png|right]]The '''Excalibur''', more commonly known as the Blade of Angmar, is a sword that has existed for thousands and years, since the forming of the Templar Order. According to legend, Notch, the creator of Minecraftia, sent down the sword with a mighty lightning strike. The first to discover it was Alexander Miguel Cross, a preacher of Notch  and the ancestor of Josef Furnace (Daniel Cross). Alexander knew that it was his responsibility  to spread Notch's word, and usher in a new world, a better world, that could be described only as a land of peace, freedom, and justice.



The Excalibur was passed down to the eldest son of each generation, with the exception of the son being lost, in which case it would be heavily guarded at the Strongold of Angmar until the son was found. Josef Furnace only found out he was the heir of Alexander Cross many years after he became part of the Order. Wielders of the Excalibur usually become the Grand Master of the Templars after they prove themselves worthy of the title.



The blade is said to have been forged by Notch himself deep in the Farlands, with unbreakable Bedrock and shining diamond. It ignites monsters when they come in contact with it, and peacefully lays to rest any mortals who are slain by it. Despite its endless power, it weighs no more than a feather due to an enchantment by Notch. When the Templar Order falls, the blade will catch fire and be sent into the End dimension, never to be retrieved again.

A Fancy Creeper looks the exact same as a creeper, but wears a tall top hat.
==Description==
A fancy creeper spawns in light levels 8 or above, but is rarely seen in the Overworld. If you're (un)lucky enough to find one of these buggers, you'd best have a diamond tool! They are only injured by diamonds, and even then, they have 14 hearts. If killed, they normally drop rarer items that would be found in a dungeon, abandoned mine shaft, or deep below the surface of the Overworld.

''What's wrong with surrendering to madness, that's where the true peace is''               

Michael Simmons aka Valerian Arterius is exiled demon originally from Trenazolore in the twilight forest, who left his dimension via nether portal to the world of Minecraftia, he is skilled in Blood Magic, alchemy and dark magic, which was the reason why he was exiled from the twilight forest for all eternity due to his misdeeds that he committed.
==&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:20px;&quot;&gt;Personality &lt;/span&gt;==
Michael is neutral but malevolent, he is both skilled in the ways of combat and magic, he is able to craft tools to use at his disposal and knows how to survive the elements. Michael is skilled in Blood magic, enchanting, alchemy and architecture but he only knows the basics of machinery due to demons depending on magic and naturally resources while machinery not being one of them since they do not have the knowledge to create or use their complicated functions.
==Appearance ==
Michael is humanoid with some slight differences, he has dark grey skin, black hair. silver red eyes, sharp canine like teeth, pointed ears along with two verticle lines going through his eyes from his hairline down to his neck. His apparel is a dark and bight red coat with shoulder pads, black trousers, belt and shoes, and a white bandage scarf around his neck with two bandages hanging loosely down his back both marked with light grey verticle eyes.  
==Biography==
Born and raised in the city of Trenzalore in the Twilight Forest, he lost both of his parents at a young age and was forced to live on his own, where he spent most of his time hunting and learning the ways of sorcery and alchemy, he became truly fascinated with the dark arts and eventually got caught during a incantation and exiled from the twilight forest for all eternity.

He was sent to the world of minecraftia where he wandered the lands finding a suitable place to build a home in a in a hollowed out mountain side, quiet far from civilization which would shun him due to his appearance. he created many potions to hide his identity from the public eye and going under the identity of Michael Simmons, who lives with his parents on the other side of the forest.

Upon his first visit to the nether, he encountered a pale faced man in a suit along with a zombie paladin and a humanoid creeper, the pale man was revealed to be israphel who offered Michael power and knowledge and allow him to indulge himself in the dark arts of blood magic in exchange to his loyalty to the cult of israphel and to follow his every command without question. 

Michael was enticed by this offer and eventually accepted his proposal, israphel then ordered Michael to go to the jade sentinel and find out a way to revive them but Michael stated that his kind is not familiar with machines, which israphel in turn said that he can provide with some assistance with the matter and that israphel can put him to good use for his plans.

Once goldenoink created a village 

Townspeople=Chickens

One Saturday night Herobrine sent zombies out to destroy the village.   The Zombies turned chicken villagers into Zombie chicken villagers

Red Panda and Tapir escaped the village because of the zombie invasion 

Then they got hunted by Mega2098

goldenoink was the only survivor.

It's unknown what happened to Pink River Dolphin. He probably drowned.

[[File:017.jpg|thumb|312px|Fort Liberty]]Fort Liberty is the sight of a battle between the soldiers of the Overworld and the Nether Legion. The Overlord soldiers had been pushed back to their last fort to defend against the Nether Legion. Fort Liberty was the sight of the last stand in the war for the Overworld soldiers. After 13 days of endless and intense combat the Nether Legion took the fort. After 200 years of the Nether Legion ruling the Overworld, the Overworld citizens rebelled and attacked the fort which was being used as the heart of the government. In the rebellion only one Overworld soldier perished. That man was Pvt. Herobrine who many believe still walks on the grounds of the Overworld with us.

At the fort conditions were very harsh. The soldiers were suited with leather armor and stone swords and bow and arrows. All that was offered for food was under cooked pork that caused sickness and fatigue to the soldiers.

[[File:018.jpg|thumb|286px|A view of the inside of the fort.]]As seen to the right the Fort was generally cramped. The soldiers had complained to their general but he did nothing about it. He instead thought winning the war was more important than living conditions.[[File:019.jpg|thumb|left|224px]] To the left is a view of inside the baracks. Typically the soldiers armed with swords would line up on the inside in a square formation. The archers would sit atop the guard towers and along the scaffolds that stretch around the fort, always visible to the soldiers who were laying in bed. [[File:020.jpg|thumb]]To the right is the scafolds that would be used by archers.

Fort Liberty is now known as a historical landmark and seen as a token of prosperity and perseverence by the people of the Overworld.

NOTE: The Nether Legion consist of anything that exist in the Nether in the current update for the 360 Edition or anything in the Nether in future updates.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="992">==Story==
[[File:New_Bitmap_Image.png|frame|A picture of goatfin.]]Goatfin was once an average Mincraftian. He adventured, he mined, he crafted. Until one day, he decided that what he had done wasn't enough. So he built himself a city. Skyscrapers, supermarkets, you get the idea. Now he builds 24/7. One time he even built a complex Restone time machine. He actually became so obsessed with building, his present whereabouts are unknown...
==Trivia==
*Since he has built a time machine, his disappearence could be related to that.
*The arrow on his shirt could possibly symbolize something, like &quot;Build from the ground up.&quot;
*Reported sightings of goatfin are very obscure.
**He was once said to have been seen by a minigame portal on a Bukkit server.
**He was once said to have been seen near a player's house, but was gone in the next split second...
**There are many more reported sightings.
*Goatfin has a curl in his hair.
*Though it has been said he has a city, it has never been found.</text>

'''Greeniehead''' is a player in the world of Minecraftia who is a little obsessed with the color green.  He is an insane green man who is very derpy and would do anything for emeralds.

==The Background of Greeniehead==

When Greeniehead was a noob in the world of Minecraftia, he was a pretty bad noob.  He didn't know much but became very experienced in very little time.  Although, he is not very good at redstoning but can figure out a few things if given enough time.  He is a master of alchemy and knows all recipes for all potions and will sell them for a very fair price.

==Sightings==

Greeniehead has been sighted on servers such as The Noob Adventures Server as the alchemist for King Max, long ago on Stompzcraft before they banned him for no reason whatsoever, he has been sighted a few times on Childcraft and may be friends with the owner but this has not been confirmed, and once he was seen on xRpMx13's server but not for very long.

==Known Aliases==
Greeniehead has been known to be called Greeniefish when he is swimming in lava using his specially brewed fire resistance potions, Greenie is the most common, and he is occasionally known by his real name which is not known at this moment.

==Known Friends==
Greeniehead has been known to have made friends with many other players in the past such as Averageswallow42, Zuelatak(but have not spoken to each other in a long time), Biggerjohn, and one Meeblfallen.  He has also been seen occasionally working with or against an odd one known only as Saladalas.

==Behavior==
This weird player has been known as a very good alchemist and will sell items for fair prices.  He will also buy emeralds at very good prices to the sellers.  He makes all potions with all different effects and is a dangerous one to fight if he has a diamond sword and a strength II potion.  Has been seen in PVP areas but then disappear, we suspect he uses his own brew of invisibility potions to mess with people because after he disappears people sometimes randomly get hit with swords and arrows.

==About Him==
Real Name: Unknown

Race: Dwarven Greenman

Skills: Punching trees, Alchemy, and a few abilities with redstone.

Favorite Item: Emerald Blocks

Favorite Color: Take a guess

Favorite Potion: Invisibility Extended

PVP Style: Attack, drink invisibility potion, hold nothing, run, fire arrows from safe distance.(in that order)

Favorite Food: POTATOS (yes we know that's spelled wrong but that is how he spells it so that's how it will be done)

Favorite Minecrafter: Honeydew

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1451">[[File:Hidden.png|left]]The Halite Blade was an enchanted weapon used by the Great Necromancer. He used the weapon to almost conquer the world of Minecraftia, but when he was defeated and banished to the Nether, the weapon was smashed into pieces. Only two of the four blades was left intact, and it was sought after for many years. Finally, the young Templar Order discovered the blades at the dawn of their power, and since they were passed down the Cross family line along with the Excalibur.


==Reformation==
Many years after Josef Furnace received the Excalibur, it was stolen by the Al Hashashin order. By the time it was retrieved, it was heavily damaged and smashed into pieces. Seeing taht the blade could no longer be used, he spent years collecting Halite fragments that remained from the destroyed Halite blade. Once all the pieces were found, they were combined with what was left with the Excalibur, making the ultimate weapon. It is used by Furnace today.
==Powers and Description==
The current Halite blade is sea green and has a golden core from the Excalibur. It takes the shape of a sabre, and is very fast and efficient in battle. It still retains the enchantment from the Great Necromancer (AKA Herobrine), including the ability to summon lightning strikes and control ocean waves. It also ignites any monsters that come in contact with it, due to the fragments from the Excalibur.

Henos18 is a former griefer and is currently a 
[[File:Download (14).png|thumb|244x244px]]
moderator on the METRO server
== life as a griefer ==
As a griefer, Henos18 was responsible for many griefs in at least 40 different servers, and killed 500 players and 100 moderators in each of the 40 servers. Henos18 was therefore wanted in those 40 servers and the moderators in the servers were instructed to bring Henos18 to the admins, where he would be banned, though Henos18 was always able to escape the moderaters one way or another. Henos18 was known to use TNT and lava for his griefs and he used an iron sword enchanted with unbreaking III to kill the players and moderators. Henos18's partner was Miles Tunic

== Becoming a moderator ==
After many minecraft years of evading the moderators, Henos18 was captured by the METRO server moderators during a grief gone wrong, with Miles escaping, and was presented to the admins. The head admin, Simpleman376, gave Henos18 a choice, either face instant ban or become a moderator and in return, Henos18 would be pardoned of all the crimes he committed. Henos18 chose the latter, and was administered into the METRO server moderator academy, where he was trained by veteran moderator HarkerIron. Henos18 learnt how to remove griefers from a server when he killed them. Henos18 then graduated and became a moderator. Henos18 became a devoted moderator, and was considered the best moderator because he could use his knowledge as a former griefer to catch the griefers in the METRO server. He also became friends with a player called Coal.

== The Jacktheripper101 case ==
2 years after becoming a moderator, a griefer suddenly appeared on the METRO server. Identifying him as [[Jacktheripper101]], the most wanted griefer for griefing a lot of servers for the past 13 years. Henos18 was assigned to lead a manhunt for Jacktheripper101. Henos18 became determined to bring Jacktheripper101 to justice after Coal was killed by Jacktheripper101. Henos18 tried to take him down, but he gave up after Jacktheripper101 disappeared. 8 years later, however, Henos18 was able to confirm that Jacktheripper101 had resurfaced, and 5 years after Jacktheripper101 resurfaced, Henos18 and Jacktheripper101 confronted each other on a bridge above a lava pit and engaged in a sword fight, ending with Henos18 setting Jacktheripper101 on fire with 'the griefer punisher, finally avenging Coal.

== A familiar face ==
At age 35, another griefer appeared in the METRO server called 'The Creeper' because he wore a creeper mask. 'The Creeper' then left a message saying 'Meet me at the place where you were captured'. After going there, Henos18 confronts 'The Creeper', who reveals himself to be Miles Tunic. Miles asks Henos18 to join him again, but Henos18 rejects him.

== Moderator weapon ==
As a moderator, Henos18 uses 'the griefer punisher' to replace his old iron sword

== 'the griefer punisher'[[Category:Players]] ==
'The griefer punisher' is a custom-made diamond sword Henos designed. It has unbreaking III, strength II and looting II.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1046">HeroDestroyer generation 1 is a legendary robotic mob/player that a player saw on an SSP tekkit game. He is a cyborg, possessing various abilities. He is quite possibly the most powerful living thing in minecraft, a product of Herobrine meddling with tekkit. He is claimed to be seen rarely on SMP servers.
==Abilities==
HeroDestroyer has many abilities, such as:
*Laser cannons (his arms shoot bolts like arrows with flame)
*flamethrower (his arm shoots a fiery blast that lights stuff on fire)
*missiles (he rarely shoots missiles that act like TNT blasted by another block of TNT, but explode on contact and seek the targeted player
*enhanced eyesight (can see the player, aim, and become hostile at the max range of chunk generation)
*enhanced speed (faster than a spider)
*enhanced strength (knockback 2-like punching)
*machine gun (sort of like a high speed bow, but the arrows are infinitely fast)
*can break blocks and has extrodinary redstone logic AI
*super-tough (like, iron golem type)

&quot;''...Only God can help you now.''&quot;&lt;br /&gt;-Herobrine, once he has cornered an innocent miner.

==The Story of Herobrine==
Herobrine originated from the story and pictures of a miner, who brought it to the attention of the public. He stated he had spotted the character building strange tunnels and structures, and stalking him across the map.

Herobrine first became ''famous'' when a few miners, who were doing a broadcast, staged a run-in with the mysterious man. Soon after, other miners began staging these run-ins with the mystic Herobrine. These were soon discovered to be hoaxes, until one miner confronted Notch, and asked if Herobrine was real. Notch pondered this thought, and replied &quot;maybe.&quot;

Miners were now sparked. At &quot;Minecon 2011,&quot; Notch released Herobrine ''would'' exist.

In several news patches, Notch announced Herobrine was gone. Many of Notch's colleagues have denounced Herobrine's existence, but it is unknown.

==Variations==

*The stalker version of Herobrine is Notch's brother, who stalks the player, disappearing if approached. This variation is most likely derived from another internet creepy-pasta, Slenderman.
*The miner version of Herobrine is a vengeful miner that tries to ensnare the player in traps, presumably to steal their items. He waits for people to enter his dungeons, then either seals them inside, or &quot;teleports&quot; behind them, presumably killing them. Some variations of this particular version says he breaks the player's creations, and steals their items from chests.

In all versions, Herobrine is a human ghost entity, with the only variable being his intentions and construction abilities, or lack thereof.

Herobrine is known as the ghost of Minecraft, the Lord of the Nether even. He is hated and feared by many, as the Lord of Evil in Minecraft. But is this so? Here is his true story.

'''Herobrine's first day.'''

Once, long, long ago, when Minecraftia was in his first year of life, two brothers were searching for diamonds. One was called Stebrine, the other was Herobrine. It was his first day. As they continued, Stebrine found an empty mineshaft. Exploring the mineshaft, they found much rotten flesh, bones, arrows, gunpowder and ender pearls. They also found the remnants of sticks, planks of wood, iron swords, and pickaxes. It appeared that a great battle had occurred. Exploring farther, they stumbled upon a zombie hoard, which they quickly destroyed. As they continued, they found that an army was amassing under the very world of Minecraftia, made of creepers, zombies, skeletons, and endermen. They tried to get out to warn Notch, but were captured by five endermen and were brought before the &quot;Enderking&quot; himself. He gave them a choice: join him or die. They chose their own choice: die fighting. Breaking out of their chains, they battled a hoard of endermen and pursed the Enderking and cornered him. However, in the ensueing battle, a wall was broken, and behind it was a lavafall, which destoyed the whole army of mobs. But the Enderking escaped, and cast a spell on Stebrine and Herobrine, turning one into the guardian of minecraftia, and the other into the god of war. And so began the eternal feud between the two. The god of war gained the powers of war, while the guardian was blessed with the ways of Justice. So, if you ever see Herobrine, think to yourself: which one is it?

==The Story of Honeydew==

Honeydew, an enigmatic Dwarf, was not actually born in Khaz Modan (though the witty Dwarf does try to enforce the rumor as much as possible) and was actually brought up in southern Minecraftia, in the Dwarf city of Dwergholme. Taller than most Dwarves, Honeydew quickly rose in renown in the city, as he developed his strength ever more, even claiming to his father that he had the &quot;strength of moose&quot;. Being an adventurous Dwarf, Honeydew often travelled around the southland, deep into the deserts surrounding Dwergholme. Not much is known about the time in between His birth and his chance encounter with the spaceman [[Xephos]], but it is theorized that the Dwarf made friends with many of the tribes around the city, and the native Humans. After Honeydew had met Xephos, the pair moved north, to experience the cold, which was only fabled in the south of Minecraftia, and to live together in whatever abode they could make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size=1&gt;Taken from the [http://yogwiki.com/Honeydew Yogscast Wiki].&lt;/font&gt;

==Appearance==
Honeydew's &quot;skin&quot; is a Caucasian male-dwarf wearing a pair of leather trousers, gloves, and a single harness around his torso. He occasionally sports different wear, but that is what he normally wears. He has bright red hair, and a long beard.

==basic info==

Name: Howiewolf

Sex: female

Age: teenage (not saying real age)

== introduction ==

Hello! My screename is howie and I am a minecrafter.  I currently play on the Xbox 360.

== how I got into minecraft  ==

Minecraft came out in the 4th grade for me,  and if you asked me what I thought on minecraft in the fouth grade, I would have said it was stupid and didn't make any sense.  But in 5th grade, I got curious and started watching youtube videos about the game. Youtubers like Stampylonghead gave me a general idea of the vanilla game. Finally, I decided to download the free 30 min tutorial on the Xbox.  Even though the game was only 30 minutes and I couldn't save my world, I still became addicted to the game and I played the tutorial over and over.   I actually discovered that I was good at fighting the vanilla mobs and I constantly ventured into dark places to defeat mobs. Finally, I got the full game. My younger sister decided to buy the disk game for the family Xbox for all of us to play.  I created my world, and I went right to making a stone sword and fighting various mobs. Then the classic minecraft story continues.

== my fursona ==

While playing the game, I started to develope a fursona, an animal who represented who I was in minecraft. I developed Howie, the female dire wolf who was good at fighting and had an army of wolves to fight with her.  Her arch enemy is, (like any minecrafter) Herobrine. 

== trivia ==

. I am currently not doing any multiplayer at the moment

. My first death in minecraft involved a giant sky island that I built and my sister telling me to jump off. 

. My best building project is the front of my house, I spent a few days on it.

. My sister and I are building a hungergames map called Candycorn Landia

. Mooshrooms are the best</text>

==History==
'''The Israphel's Castle''' was built some time after the resurrection of Israphel. It was the home of the Cult of Israphel for a time, before the heroes [[Honeydew]] and [[Xephos]] came, led by Old_Peculier, to rescue Daisy_Duke. Though Israphel escaped with Daisy, the heroes slew the Creeper_Boss and Zombie_Boss (for a time).

It is assumed to now be abandoned, along with the town above, [[Terrorvale]].The City of Terrovale was destroyed by Herobrine during his raid on Israphel's Castle.The adventurers Honeydew and Xephos came back.

==About JC21==
JC21 is more often playing creative mode, and playing survival mode when he get bored with the creative mode. Likes making pranks, JC21 always wearing a white softlens and acting just like a [http://mcplayers.wikia.com/wiki/Herobrine Herobrine] itself. JC21 also likes to killing creeper than any other mob (example: skeletons, zombie, etc). So thats he always wearing a creeper skin on his back so the other people can indentificate him. Ironically, despite being like killing creepers, in single-player, he likes to turn the difficulty to peaceful mode. This is because he has so many villager guys, to prevent the creeper explode on the villager that also can wreck his Bikini Bottom.

==The Story of jeb_==
It is unknown where &quot;jeb_&quot; came from, but it is certain that without him, [[Notch]] may have never been able to form Minecraftia. He is credited with forming wolves, inventing pistons, and much more.

He often wrote the news patches, and performed Notch's day-to-day dirty work. In all senses, the residents of Minecraftia are indebted to the mystical guru.

==Appearance==
Jeb_'s &quot;skin&quot; is currently an elderly Caucasian man wearing a dark tunic with a light shirt and trousers. He wears a wreath around his head, and has a cloak with the Mojang symbol around his shoulders.

He is rarely seen outside his mystical workshop, which no ordinary Minecraftian has ever visited.
==Notes==
*Jeb did not actually ''invent'' pistons. It was originally a mod, which he greatly enjoyed, and added to the vanilla game.

==Biography==
Jens Bergensten was originally hired by [[Mojang]] as a back-end developer for Scrolls, but took an interest in a new game they were developing, Minecraft. After aiding [[Markus Persson]] in the development of Minecraft, Bergensten was made lead developer, and took over the &quot;dirty-work&quot; of everyday coding and small development.


==Current Work==
Bergensten is currently working as the head developer of Minecraft, and is often behind his computer, improving the game. Whilst Persson begins work on ''0x10&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;'', Bergensten has kept developing, and it is doubted he has any intention of stopping.

'''Jeremiah Octavius Garland ''' was a Galician mercenary captain who served as the second Grand Master of the Order of the Templars, doing so from 576 until 587.
==Biography==
''Note: The following is roughly 90% factual, 10% fictional. Some of the material below is embellished for entertainment, literary, and realistic purposes. For example, never did the Templars lead &quot;vast armies&quot; into battles or war, since Templar membership has been, at most, 30 users. Therefore, such exaggerations and hyperbola exist only to improve the quality of an otherwise bland and typical story. Furthermore, much of what you are about to read is based on actual events. To give another example, consider the first bit below about Jeremiah Garland growing up in a coastal village in a far-off land, becoming a commanding warrior victorious throughout many tribal wars. Whilst this may seem irrelevant to the game of Minecraft (which it is), the idea for this was pulled from one of the first server I frequented, in which I roleplayed a village warrior, often engaged in PvP with rival villages. Many (but not all) of the names are also fabricated with basis elsewhere; &quot;Haras&quot; is a realistic name more fit for a story than &quot;Rocket_93&quot;. If a character is killed in the story, it can mean one of several things: they were simply killed in PvP (often the case), they stopped frequenting that particular server, or they stopped playing Minecraft altogether. The year system is implemented for further literary effect, with the following rough translations: 544 to 565 equals 2010, 566 to 570 equals 2011, 571 to 579 equals 2012, 580 to 586 equals 2013, and 587 to 592 equals 2014.''
===Early Life===
Not much is known about Garland's early life, other than he was born on October 4, 544, in the province of Galicia. His official birth name is recorded to be '''Iyramis Ryrgor Elisirsson Geirlyne''', which, upon his arrival in Mycelia, he anglicised to '''Jeremiah Garland''', also taking the middle name '''Octavius''' (which he has used as an alias on more than one occasion). Galicia, a mountainous region on the outer rim of Minecraftia, is a regional home to several clans of bearded warriors, the Galicians. The Galicians are renowned for their rugged, somewhat barbaric appearance, exceptional skills in weaponry (especially the bow), raiding nearby islands and villages aboard their iconic longboats, and most importantly, master miners of the earth, as they're extremely mountainous region offers many valuables.

Jeremiah was born in the Galician village of Tórshavn, a quaint village overlooking Galicia's rocky crags and the Galician sea. His parents were Elisir and Sigga Geirlyne, both of whom loved Jeremiah very much, for he was their only child. However, in 548, when Jeremiah was only four years old, the village of Tórshavn suffered a massive raid from a nearby rival village, in which a large amount of Tórshavn's population was killed. Among the casualties was Jeremiah's parents, Elisir and Sigga, both of whom died protecting their son.

After the raid, Jeremiah, still very young, was soon found by a family friend and an elder of the village, Kato the Wise. Kato cared for Jeremiah as if he was his own child, and Jeremiah soon grew to love Kato as well. Kato, an avid warrior, taught Jeremiah how to use a blade and shoot a bow; Jeremiah caught on quickly, and was proclaimed a natural. He also tutored Jeremiah in subjects such as astronomy, chemistry, Galician history, navigation, and of course, the Galician art of mining.

When Jeremiah was thirteen, Kato suddenly died of a heart attack. Traumatized by this loss, Jeremiah, out of sadness and anger ran away from Tórshavn and lived alone in the untamed foothills surrounding the village. Through the survival and fighting skills Kato had taught him, Jeremiah managed to fend for himself, and survive alone in the wilderness for three years. When he was sixteen, he was discovered by a hunting party from his village, who were astonished to see Jeremiah was still alive all this time. They asked him to return to the village.
===The Galician Wars===
Back in Tórshavn, Jeremiah discovered that the village had gone to war with a rival tribe (the very same tribe that had killed his parents), the village of Aervik to the north. Eager to get revenge on his parents' murderers, Jeremiah volunteered to fight the hostile village. The war, which would become known as the Third Galician War, hosted several battles between the two major tribes. In one of the earliest major battles, the Battle of Árborg Pass, Garland showed fierce skills on the battlefield, reportedly killing up to twenty Aervikians alone. In one particular moment during the battle, he had jumped in front of his commander to block an enemy marksman's arrow, which pierced his leather armour but left him relatively unhurt. For his bravery and skill on the battlefield, Garland soon rose through the ranks, and was eventually granted his own regiment to command.

As more and more tribes and villages within Galicia began to choose sides and the war escalated, Garland and his fighting party soon found themselves involved in more and more battles. Even though the Tórshavnians had suffered subtle losses at major battles such as the Battle of Langøya Creek and the Siege of Harstad, Garland continued to show promise on the battlefield, and in 563, was promoted to general.

Garland's breakthrough battle came in 564, during the height of the Third Galician War, at the Battle of Isgárleif. Isgárleif, a vital fishing island and valuable mining post located on the eastern edge of Galicia, had since been taken by Aervik forces and their allied tribes. Garland's duty was to retake the island, even though he had an army extremely smaller than the army occupying Isgárleif: they had him outnumbered by a five to one margin. Even still, Garland ordered the attack on the island. In the early hours of the morning on April 12 of that year, the small Tórshavn army raided the island, taking the enemy by surprise. The battle lasted for three days, before the Tórshavn army, extremely outnumbered, managed to prevail over the enemies, only losing a small fraction of their men. Garland himself had led his troops on the battlefield, personally killing a reported forty-two hostiles. In the process he had been shot by an arrow once in his shoulder, twice on the lower leg, and speared once in the upper chest. Despite this, Garland carried on and fought valiantly. For his actions and the unlikely taking of Isgárleif, Garland was hailed as one of the greatest generals in Galician history, and made a celebrated war hero in his home town of Tórshavn.
===Journey to Mycelia===
After the Third Galician War ended a few months after the events at Isgárleif, when the Aervikians surrendered, Garland, only nineteen years old, retired from his post as general, willing to lead a life of peace. However, war once again found its way to Tórshavn, when other enemy tribes began conducting raids. The nobles of Tórshavn looked towards Garland to come out of retirement and once again repel the enemies, but Garland refused. To avoid the incoming war, Garland decided he'd leave Galicia, and seek solace in far-off lands. On July 19, 565, Garland left Tórshavn in the middle of the night.

He traveled on foot for several months across the varying incredible landscapes of Minecraftia. While passing through the arid desert region of Tungisia, Garland was ambushed in the night by a small party of highwaymen. Blade in hand, Garland overpowered his attackers, but allowed them to escape with their lives. He let them go free, each with a gold ingot.

Finally, after traveling for three months west across the land, Garland came to the Great Ocean, which, on the other side, lay the lands he craved to reach. After slipping aboard a merchant's ship bound for the continent of Olexia, Jeremiah sailed upon the sea for another two months, before the ship finally reached the icy banks of New Elgin, the capital and largest port of the Kingdom of Mycelia. New Elgin, a cultured city quite often nicknamed &quot;Rock and Dirt&quot; (because of its rough external appearance), had recently fallen under the leadership of a new lord mayor, David McMartin. McMartin himself was a high-ranking official of Mycelia's largest company, Aperture, which held a peaceful economic monopoly over the kingdom and had emerged as the wealthiest corporation in Olexia. The chief owner of Aperture was an ambitious scientist named Josef Furnace.

Garland bought a house in New Elgin, and settled happily. He met and befriended a wealthy resident of New Elgin, a man his age named [http://mcplayers.wikia.com/wiki/Rocket_93 Haras]. Garland and Haras would often dream about starting their own town like New Elgin, and watch it grow over time. This dream would eventually become reality.

After his first six months in Mycenia, Garland had run out of all the money he had brought with him, and knew he had to find a new way to get money. He searched around the kingdom for work, when he was finally offered a job working for a small-scale mining operation. Given his Galician heritage and knack for mining, he accepted for a decent pay. His employer and head of the operation was a Mycenian statesman named Archibald Bane. The next day, Garland began his work by traveling to the site of the mining operation, on a small island far off the coast of Mycelia.

For two weeks Garland made a good pay through the job, acquiring enough cash to keep some food on the table. He was an expert miner in the operation, and Archibald Bane took notice. However, the operation tragically ended when Bane was killed in a mining explosion caused by a malfunction in the TNT. Jeremiah barely escaped the incident with his life. He took whatever funds Bane had made through the mining operation, seeing they'd be useless going to waste. Local authorities on the island soon assumed Garland had intentionally murdered Bane to steal his fund, and Garland knew he had to leave. He escaped back to New Elgin.

===Acre===
In pursuit from the law, Garland knew he had to leave the kingdom. He approached his old friend, Haras, with whom he'd often share fantasies of founding a state of their own. He proposed this idea to Haras, who was reluctant at first, seeing this as impossible. Garland, using the funds he had acquired from Bane Mining Co., eventually cajoled Haras that they had enough wealth to start their own state. Haras eventually agreed, and in November of 570, the two set out to find a suitable location for their new town.

After traveling for days by boat, the two eventually reached a small island far off from the shores of Mycelia (it was believed this island lay on the edges of the uninhabitated tundra region of Moorsland). With the island located strategically in the opening of a bay, and plenty of snow-covered hills to offer protection from invaders, the two agreed this island would be ideal for the location of their soon-to-be town. They immediately set up camp and laid down the cornerstone.

They agreed to name the town Acre, after an ancient stronghold (Acrésveld) that sat not far from New Elgin.

As construction on the city began, residents from New Elgin and other locations in Mycelia were soon brought to the island to help populate the city. Acre grew within weeks, and soon a small militia force was established. Garland was proclaimed commander of the Acrean Militia Force, while Haras was elected mayor of the city.
===Aperture===

It was also during this time that word of Garland's victories overseas and successful career as a young warrior general reached the ears of the Mycelians. As such, many organisations within Mycelia sought Garland's prowess, wishing to hire him as a bodyguard, hit man, tactician, and a variety of other jobs. The first company to hire Garland was Aperture, the controversial research institution headed by New Elgin resident Josef Furnace. Due to the corporation's aggressive and infamous nature, Aperture had garnered a large number of enemies and financial opponents; Furnace made quick work to dispatch Garland to eliminate these rivals. Furnace had become so impressed with Garland's work that he named him proctor (head of security) of Aperture.

Garland's first and most notable mission working as Aperture's proctor was carrying out the assassination of Aperture's former chief executive officer, who had since fled New Elgin after being ousted from the position by Furnace himself. The man, known simply as &quot;Skull&quot;, had anticipated Furnace would soon send a hitman for his life, so had locked himself away in a tower on a small island far offshore from New Elgin. Furthermore, he had constructed a sizable force of iron golems for protection, and even hired a bodyguard; an ominous bounty hunter named &quot;Shadow Knight&quot;.

In January of 571, Garland successfully located Skull's island and approached it under the darkness of night. His presence, however, was soon noticed. Wielding an axe, Garland quickly disabled a good number of iron golems, on guard in the tower's courtyard. In the process of ascending the tower to assassinate Skull, Garland was ambushed by Shadow Knight, who attempted to knock Garland off of the tower's narrow ladder with arrows. After Garland was shot with an arrow in the back leg, he managed to scrabble away into one of the tower's storage rooms to recover. He immediately drank a healing potion Furnace had provided for him, removed the arrow from his leg, and hid amongst the stockpile of chests. Shadow Knight entered the room, anticipating to finish off Garland. Whilst he was searching the room, Garland sprang from his hiding spot, blade in hand, taking Shadow Knight by surprise. The two engaged in a short duel before Garland overpowered his opponent. Shadow Knight's sword was knocked from his hands and he sat on his knees defenceless. Rather than finish him, Garland decided to let the bounty hunter go free, declaring it was not him he had come to kill. Shadow Knight thanked Garland, and evacuated the tower.

Garland finished his ascent of the tower to come face-to-face with Skull, who had been prepared for his arrival; he had armed himself with a powerful sword. Skull taunted Garland, and proceeded to insult Josef Furnace and Aperture. To this, Garland responded with a heavy strike which Skull barely blocked. At once the two began a lengthy battle, which concluded after a blow from Garland had heavily injured Skull's right arm, causing him to lose his sword. Defenceless, wounded, and obviously defeated, Skull threw a final insult to Garland before jumping from the tower, taking his own life as he fell to the ground in the courtyard below. Garland recited a short Galician invocation before setting the tower alight and descending to retrieve Skull's body and return it to Aperture.

===The Templars===
After an extended bout working in Aperture's facilities, Garland returned to Acre in early 571 to find the city flourishing under Haras's leadership. After word of Acre's success reached Furnace, he wished to put the township under Aperture's jurisdiction; he expressed these wishes in a letter to Garland. Confused, Garland returned once more to Aperture. It was at this time he first learned about the Order of the Templars: a secret society of loyal fighters who strive to expand their influences to all edges of society. Furnace explained how Aperture was simply a front for the Templar Order, and how New Elgin was already under Templar control; indeed, the Lord Mayor of New Elgin, David McMartin, was a Templar. Furnace also expressed his desire to expand the Templar realm to cover all of Olexia, and conquering Acre would be necessary. As a final test before his initiation into the Templars, Garland was to overthrow his friend Haras from the mayorship in Acre, and assume control of the city. Garland, seeing the Templars as an ominous yet worthy cause, reluctantly accepted this task.

===The Acrean Civil War===
In the summer of 571, Garland returned once more to Acre to find some of the civilians somewhat displeased by Mayor Haras. Taking advantage of the situation, Garland began spreading rumours across the city of Haras's misdeeds. Soon, two factions emerged in the city: those who saw Haras as a tyrant and felt that Garland was the rightful founder, and therefore ruler of Acre; and those who remained loyal to Haras. Clashes soon broke out between the two groups, and casualties were taken. On August 3, 571, after the Acre City Hall was burned down overnight, Mayor Haras blamed Garland for this, and, due to his betrayal, banished Garland from the city and took full control of the Acrean Militia. Garland and his followers returned to New Elgin, where they eventually garnered the support of the Templar mayor. Three weeks and two assassination attempts later, Garland returned to Acre with a sizeable force from New Elgin under his control; he besieged the city in an event known as the Siege of Acre.

During the three-day-long siege, dozens of casualties were taken on both sides, due to many small skirmishes that took place outside the city gates. Finally, in the early morning of the fourth day, Garland's forces broke through the walls of Acre, and stormed the town. The main militia force was ultimately defeated after a short yet intense battle in the main city's square, and Garland himself, sword drawn, marched into the mayor's mansion in the heart of the city where he took Haras prisoner. At approximately noon of that day, August 27, 571, Garland was proclaimed the new mayor of Acre.

Shortly thereafter, Garland rode to the city's holding cells, where he approached his fallen friend, Haras. Crestfallen, Haras asked Garland what his motives were in taking control of the city. Garland then explained to him the Templars; how Josef Furnace, the Templars' grandmaster, had assigned him the task as his initiation. Haras mentioned how he was familiar with the Templar Order, and expressed interest in himself becoming a member. Seeing as he was victorious, Garland wrote to Furnace, inquiring as to whether Haras could be admitted as a Templar as well. Furnace approved, noting Haras on his vigilance, courage, and skill as a leader, and on September 4, 571, Garland and Haras travelled together back to Mycelia, where they both took the Templar Oath and were officially proclaimed members of the Order. Subsequently, Haras was reinstated as the mayor of the now-Templar controlled city of Acre.

===The Rise of a Dynasty===
With Acre now under Aperture's belt, the Templars soon came out of secrecy and divulged their underlying leadership and intentions on the citizens of Mycelia. In November of that year, a new arrival appeared in Mycelia: a long-lost friend of Furnace named Parax, the Baron von Shush. At once Garland and Parax formed a close friendship. Parax was also sworn in as a member of the Order of the Templars, and the lineup was at last complete: Furnace, the Grandmaster; Garland, the right hand; Haras, the mayor of Acre; Parax, the Treasurer; and McMartin, the mayor of New Elgin.

Soon the Templar Order had conquered more and more lands surrounding Mycelia, expanding the kingdom's boundaries greatly. Eventually, rival nations began taking notice of Mycelia's new empire, and began to challenge their success. The most prominent of these nations was the New California Republic, or NCR, led by an infamous tyrant named Daves Davy. Davy had garnered the aid of an NCR commando – John Breasly – as well as an NCR general of the army – Leonasta – in constructing a hidden base within the mountains of Mycelia. The three used this post to intercept messages from Mycelia as well as surveil Templar activity. Eventually, Aperture discovered NCR's base, and war was soon declared between NCR and Mycelia.
===The Eight Week War===
In preparation for the war, Lord Mayor David McMartin had established a conscription across the Kingdom of Mycelia. Able-bodied men were soon called upon to join the Mycelian army. Perhaps the most notable of these men was a young soldier named Albert Spark. Coming from a mysterious iced-over land to the north, Spark distinguished himself early on in the war. Garland, meanwhile, had been named the commanding general of the Mycelian forces, whilst Furnace was named the directing coordinator. Parax, meanwhile, single-handedly holstered the Mycelian economy through his vast wealth, making the price of war well within the Templars' grasp.

On December 2, 571, the first battle of what would become known as the Eight Week War occurred. NCR forces, led by General Leonasta, began a direct assault on the Mycelian capital of New Elgin by marching through the eastern mountains dividing the city from NCR territory. Word of this advance was intercepted by Parax's sources, and soon a sizable Mycelian force was assembled in the foothills. The NCR's army arrived at the headquarters of Aperture (which was located between New Elgin and the Mycelian Range) before they were ambushed by a sizable Templar force led by Grand Master Furnace himself. General Leonasta called for a full retreat.

Meanwhile, the leader of the NCR, Daves Davy, had himself remained stationed in the NCR's covert mountain base within Mycelian territory. Seeing as New Elgin was too well-defended, he set his sight on the city of Acre, just to the northwest. He ordered his secondary commander, John Breasly, to take the city. Armed with a small force, Breasly besieged Acre, but was valiantly beaten back by Mayor Haras, who propelled the invaders just long enough for Templar reinforcements to arrive from the south.

The greatest Templar defeat of the brief war came on December 16, 571. In the frozen tundra far to the north of New Elgin, Aperture and the Mycelian government owned a small number of port-bases operating off of the northern seas. These became targets for the NCR. Three days prior, they began a siege of the coastal bases, defended only by a small number of unsuspecting militia. As food and heat ran short in the facilities, the NCR ultimately overran the bases, cutting off Mycelian trade access through the northern seas. Reinforcements from New Elgin failed to arrive and retake the ports due to harsh weather conditions and extreme temperatures in the brutal winter, in addition to the necessity of aiding more urgent locations.

Shortly after the shocking defeat and loss of the valuable northern bases, as well as weakening defences on the main front, the Mycelians decided it was time to go on the offensive. Albert Spark, since promoted to Colonel, was directed to lead a force and take back the &quot;Frozen LA&quot;, an NCR-held Mycelian region to the west so called because of its cold climate and city initials. Spark carried out this command on December 24, rousing an unsuspecting NCR army from their sleep, shocked to discover an enemy attack amidst the holiday season. With Frozen LA easily won back, the Mycelian army was once more encouraged to fight.

Another major Templar victory came a few days later at the Battle of Argis Pass. Argis Pass, a vital network of roads through the Mycelian mountain range, was the prospect of NCR advancement as part of their plan to march on New Elgin. However, a Templar force dually commanded by Haras and Baron von Shush halted the Templars at the pass, and sternly defended the strategic point despite being outnumbered. Casualties were costly on both sides, but ultimately the Templars prevailed as NCR was routed. The commander of the NCR forces, General Leonasta, was killed by Baron von Shush himself, who shot the retreating general with a well-fired arrow. The shocking loss of Leonasta caused NCR President Daves Davy to revert his strategy and call all men back to prepare for the defensive.

Meanwhile, Jeremiah Garland had discovered the location of the NCR's secret base, being operated by Daves Davy and his new head-general, John Breasly. With a small tact force, Garland rode out to the base in the darkness of night. He ordered his men to clear the premises before himself entering the base, alone. He planned to assassinate Davy, bringing a stealthy end to the war. However, having successfully navigated the base without detection, the blow from his sword only seriously maimed the NCR president. Before Garland could finish him off, John Breasly rushed to the aid of his leader, and engaged Garland in a duel. The subsequent fight between the two provided ample time for Daves Davy to escape the base and retreat back to the New California Republic. Seeing as Breasly and Garland were equally matched, after two hours of dueling with no yield from either side, Breasly too managed to escape, promising death to Garland and the fall of Mycelia.

Jon SpurceWood was once a famed moderator. After he was left for dead by his former partner IronMan111, he became the vigilante griefer known as Blaze101

== Biography ==

=== As Jon SpurceWood ===
Jon SpurceWood was a famed moderator, known for following the server rules and was dedicated to catching griefers. Unlike other moderators, Jon was known to be incorruptible and never gave in to bribes made by griefers, though his partner, IronMan111, was a corrupt moderator after he accepted bribes from griefer GunpowderTNT. Jon was not hesitante to expose moderators who were corrupt. One day, however, while he and IronMan111, to capture Gunpowder, IronMan111 and the other 5 moderators betrayed Jon and trapped him in a cage. Gunpowder then pulled a leaver to open 2 pistons and lava came pouring down and Jon seemingly burnt to death.

=== Becoming Blaze101 ===
Unbeknownst to all, including IronMan111, Jon had somehow survived being burnt to death. Vowing revenge on GunpowderTNT for killing him and IronMan111 betraying him, he reconstructed his skin altogether. After renaming himself Blaze101, he began planning his revenge on GunpowderTNT and IronMan111

=== Exacting his revenge ===
After 5 years of careful planning, Blaze101 then proceeded to put his plan of revenge into action. First, he kidnapped GunpowderTNT and placed him in the lava cage trap that resembled the trap Blaze was killed in. Despite Gunpowder pleading for his life, Blaze simply pulled the leaver without hesitation and watched as Gunpowder burned to death.

He joined Minecraft, got sucked up in a UFO, got knocked out by aliens, woke up on another planet, got recruited by them as a &quot;ringsoldier&quot; and fought &quot;blackops&quot; there. In 2011 a meteor crashed down in front of him and he knew it was a trap, but a mango-chrossaint flew into the meteor and he instantly jumped onboard. It took off and flew across the galaxy at the speed of light and crashed right down on [[AkselHolmsted]]. He found the other members of [[AJNLR]] and made friends with them. Then he did some stuff with them and all that.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1900">'''Josef Furnace''' was born somewhere in Mycelia, which, at the time, was a beautiful mountain top, filled with life. However, slowly, as the world of Minecraftia was corrupted by evil creatures such as the Ender Dragon, Mycelia begin to wither away and become a place of dark pits of soul sand, and deadly patches of Mycelia. For years, Josef lived in the mountains of Angmar, and took an interest in science. Unfortunately, when Myecelia was corrupted, as was Josef. Science became of obsession of his, and once he made his way out of the mountains and found a peaceful village, the evil kicked in.



For some time, Josef lived as a trader in that village. He used the money he gained there to further his experiments, and, he hoped, could destroy the village. Furnace opened Aperture Science in the town and gained a vast amount of wealth. One man known as Jeremiah Garland, elder town member, supported Furnace's cause. For years, the two raked in the emeralds and came closer to destroying the village, and, soon, much more. However, before they could, the two were halted by a small group that called themselves &quot;rebels.&quot; They challenged Aperture, and swore to stop them. Furnace and the rest of Aperture dealt with the rebels easily, without the town noticing. The rebels returned soon after, backed by a new clan called the New California Republic.



Aperture went up in flames and the two weren't seen again for years. Rumor has it they retreated into the mountains of Angmar, and set up new Aperture headquarters on top of Mycelia. While residing there, Josef apparently went through many sessions of therapy to treat his violent and cynical personality. At the same time, Jeremiah Garland helped re-open Aperture Science as Aperture Golem Co. In an effort to raise Emeralds to support their own agenda.



To be continued as the future unfolds.

==Building==

The way Joshing became good at building was: He made a Minecraft Single Player world, and continually kept building structures; of many shapes sizes and types.

Here are some direct tips from him:
#&quot;Never give up&quot;
#&quot;Know what you are building, plan it, make a draught copy somewhere else. Do some math, then go for it&quot;
#&quot;If it goes wrong, don't worry, try it again.&quot;
#&quot;Read tip one again&quot;

==Buildings==
Joshing: Mainly interested in big buildings.  Likes making small little red stone contraptions around his house, or building for that matter.  Never will give up, very proud of his buildings.

[[File:E4Bq2Dx26O0.jpg|thumb|400px]]

This mod is much like the popular Namco game, Katamari Damacy! In this mod you first must craft a Kataminey. This is made at a crafting table, the design is the same for leggins, but it's made out of dirt! Thus giving you 64 Katamineys. You then right click on it then start rolling!

&quot;''Victory''&quot; - Latias1290, after finishing his latest project after weeks of work.

'''Latias1290''' is a male Dutch Minecrafter. He is a Modder and a proficient Redstoner.
[[File:Latias1290_persp.png|thumb|Latias1290's skin, featuring a teenager wearing a fox-themed hoodie.]]

Latias1290 often plays on the [[DKCraft]] server. He spends his time working on various projects. The currently ongoing project is a big makeover of his house.

Latias1290 works on a system with an Intel Core i5, assisted by an MSI GeForce GTX 780, the whole system kept cool by 5 fans, all housed in one sleek black casing with bright blue LEDs. Since he bought the system, he took a liking to the color scheme, and has preferred it for almost anything, including his real-life clothing.

==Occupations==
===As a Skinner===
Latias1290 has made several skins. Most of them featured the default Steve skin in different outfits, such as a military suit or a griefer's disguise. His first skin was &quot;Steve on a Party&quot;, which was a simple-texture skin featuring Steve wearing a tuxedo.
Skins he made were:
* Steve on a Party[[File:Steve_on_a_party.png|thumb|150px|The Steve on a Party skin.]]
* Steve in Space
* Steve in the Army
* Steve the Farmer
* Steve the Firefighter (request)
* Steve the Redstoner
* Steve the Griefer
* Terraria Guide (request)
* Cookie Monster (request)
* TNT Man
* Nether Camo (request)
* Top-hat Man
A few months after he started making skins, most of his &quot;Steve the X&quot; skins were removed, with as reason &quot;unoriginal posts&quot;. Demotivated, Latias1290 stopped making skins, and continued to become a Modder.

===As a Modder===
Latias1290 used to make mods. However, due to the extreme lack of time needed to develop mods, combined with the slow speed of modding tutorials coming out and the speed at which Minecraft was updated, he gave up modding. He used to make the following mods:
* MoarShinies
* Mythical Metals
* YEAH API
* The Silly Mod
All of these mods required and worked with Forge Mod Loader.

The MoarShinies mod added several new gemstones to the game, including Amethyst, Emerald which was not present at the time of development, Topaz, Rubies, Sapphire, Agate, and various new colors of Diamonds.

The Mythical Metals mod added Cobalt, Mythril, and Adamantine to the game, each with their own set of tools, ores, and armor sets. It also added the Mythical Forge, which could be used to smelt ores added by the mod - a regular furnace could not smelt these ores. According to Latias1290, &quot;One does not simply smelt mythical ores with a regular furnace&quot;, hence the special furnace.

The YEAH API was, as its name suggests, an API that other modders could use to create mods for Minecraft. However, it got abandoned early in its development.

The Silly Mod added many items, blocks, and mobs to the game, most of which had no real use, and was actually used as a &quot;playground&quot; for Latias1290 to experiment with several ideas to see how they worked. Examples of the additions were bananas, happy creepers, foxes, sandwiches and glasses. The Bananas and the Sandwiches were a test to see how food worked, Happy Creepers a test to see how Artificial Intelligence worked in Minecraft(for instance, making them hug the player), Foxes were a test to see how Models and making mobs from scratch worked(and just because Latias1290 loves foxes), and the glasses were a test to see how View Overlays worked, similar to that of the Pumpkin when a player puts it in their Head armor slot.

After a few weeks of running backwards on updates, Latias1290 decided that he did not have the right requirements to make mods, and stopped making mods. He then continued to be a Griefer.

===As a griefer===
Latias1290 has griefed several servers. While he does not grief servers anymore, he used to grief servers on a very long time scale, about 6 months.

He went into work by effectively scamming the staff over the course of half a year, similar to a Master Scammer in real life. After joining and familiarizing with the rules, he played as a very kind person, helping out with most of the player's problems or questions, and after a few months, applying for a staff position. This has succeed at every griefing attempt, for the kind nature he assumed when playing as a regular player. Months later, he would apply for a higher position, usually the Administrator position. After this, he would wait for &quot;the perfect moment&quot;, which would usually be any given moment where he was the only staff member online. When this moment has come, he would ban every player, remove every player from the staff list except for himself, and, if possible, clear the entire map using WorldEdit. After finishing, he would usually make a tiny platform at the coordinates where the World Spawn used to be, and put a sign saying &quot;Didn't see that one comin', did ya?&quot;. Afterwards, he would remove every world backup and all player files.

Finally, he would remove every trace of evidence that it was his doing, including wiping the server log, removing his own name from the staff list as well and adding his own name to the ban list, and wiping the LogBlock database, if present. He would then leave, and never return.

After about 4 succeed attempts to destroy servers, Latias1290 decided that griefing had started to get boring, and became less motivated to grief anymore. After a while, he quit griefing, and continued to become an Animator.

===As an animator===
Latias1290 is currently working on an animated Minecraft short film featuring his own character, exploring a temple, finding a Nether Star, and skillfully defeating the horror that was guarding it.

Despite the high performance of his PC, he does not have much time to work on it. The reason for that is that his PC runs Ubuntu, which does not seem to like Autodesk Maya very much. It is compatible, and he has a valid license for three years, but the license cannot be confirmed by his PC. However, due to personal reasons, he is able to work on animations for 3 days every two weeks. Then, we works like he has diarrhea.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5308">'''Latias Business''' is a company run by [[Latias1290]]. It currently only exists on [[DKCraft]]. It is often abbrievated as LB or LTS Business. It is divided into multiple branches:
*Latias Business Trading - easy and secure trading between players.
*Latias Business Villager Housing - give Testificates a place to live, and players a trading post.
*Latias Business Redstone - fast yet professional redstone machines.
*Latias Business Building - from the tiniest dirt houses to the most fantastic castles - you name it.
It was previously run by Latias1290 and Stefan230799, but as Stefan230799 quit playing on DKCraft Latias Business is now run only by Latias1290.
==Trading==
A branch that allows players to trade their items while they are not both online. This is achieved by a website(not launched yet) that allows players to register buy and sell offers and wait until a suitable match is found. Once that happens, both players will get an email informing them and both players can agree for a date when they can both come online and trade their items. This branch makes its profit by taking 10% from the transaction. So for example, if a player would sell 64 oak wood logs for 50 In-game Dollars, 40 In-game dollars would be for the selling player, and 10 In-game dollars for Latias Business. It started on 1 July 2013.
==Villager Housing==
This branch goes into work by founding Villages or Apartments when Testificats can live. It currently founded 1 Village and has made housing for a total of 20 villagers. This branch makes its profit by trading with the Testificates and re-selling the traded items for a higher price. It started on 23 June 2013.
==Redstone==
Redstone contraptions and equipment for a reasonable fee. It started on 5 May 2013. Here follows the Catalogue:

==Building==
This branch is pretty obvious - it builds stuff! Prices arent predefined, but the branch judges the order and thinks up a price instead. It started on 1 July 2013.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1720">[[File:Screen_Shot_2012-11-04_at_9.26.21_AM.png|thumb|LikaBowssFreeze's Skin]]'''LikaBowssFreeze''' is a slightly famous player. LikaBowssFreeze is famous for finding the 'end' (END OF THE WORLD not 'end' home of the ender dragon) of a Minecraft world even though they are supposed to be never-ending. There was a fountain of lava spewing off a cliff into complete blackness. Torches could not be placed at the site, so it was unclear exactly what the blackness was. LikaBowssFreeze also owned one of the fastest of all-time factories, which produced 300,000 EMC of items per second. On minecraft, not tekkit.
=='''How he came to be'''==
He started as a simple old steve running around on small minecraft servers. Then he joined some bigger servers including UberMinecraft and minecrafthungergames.com. By the time he joined UberMinecraft, he created his new classic skin. A skin like the one in the picture at the side but with different colors changing around often. Always with the LikaBowssFreeze 3d glasses.
=='''Greatest Creation'''==
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;Of all the creations other than his factory, his greatest creation was a floating castle of tremendous size (picture not available). General description: archery towers made of golden blocks with hidden entries. The entrance was a huge staircase of rainbow colors (in order of head to bottom like his skin in the rainbow skin picture above. The interior contained a huge dining table, many clever booby traps, various dungeons, and a high viewing tower at the sky building limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;LikaBowssFreeze recently built a new castle.. Not as great as his other one, but a picture may be available soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3569">=='''Lostshard'''==
Lostshard is a minecraft roleplaying server. It is known for it's pvp and funny community. If you are the kind of player that doesn't like pvp and would rather build and mine don't worry. The creator Lucciddream has created many plugins that make the game extremely fun for everyone. You have certain skills you can grind such as magery, mining, and blades. These will help you while you play. 
==='''Blue and Red'''===

You start out on the server with a blue name, this means you are a lawful citizen/player. This means you can spawn in Order, the peaceful spaw, with guards that will protect you. 

If you were to kill somebody you would become a criminal, a criminial will have a grey name and will be killed by the guards if they get to close. If a criminal or murderer ever attacks you, you can say guards out loud and a guard will kill them if they are close enough.

a murderer is somebody that has killed more than 5 people. If you had 1 murder, you would have to wait 1 real life day for that kill to go away. If you have 5 it would take 5 days to have a completely clean slate. Once you had 25 murders you will stay a murderer and will only be able to lose kills again by paying at a shrine.
==='''Skills'''===
The skills on the server are very important to the gameplay. There are currently 10 skills, these are:
*mining
*blades
*archery
*magery
*brawling
*fishing
*lumberjacking
*taming
*fishing
*blacksmithy
To make sure you don't get all of these skills and become an unstoppable machine, you have a limit of 400 points, this means you can grind 4 skills up to 100. Each of them will help greatly, blacksmithy allows you to repair and smelt armor easily, mining gives you better drops from stone and faster mining, blades makes peole bleed and does more damge, and archery can pierce armor and knock people back. These will also help in deciding who you want to be, a pvper or a miner/builder. You can have two builds which means you can have one build dedicated to pvp with blades and such and one dedicated to mining. You can change your build at the spawns by finding the sign that says change build and typing /buil 0 or 1. It will kill you but you will respawn with the correct skills.
==='''Magery'''===
When most poeple get on for the first time they are either very confused or very eager to learn about magery. At first it may sound very over powered, I mean you can cast unlimited spells do what you want?! This is madness! But no Lucid thought ahead, you have a statistics bar to the side of your screen and it has the words mana and stamina. Everytime you cast a spell it will take reagents and mana, reagents are just normal items such as feathers and sugarcane. You have 100 mana and certain spells cost a certain amount of mana and once you run out you have to wait for it to recharge. The stamina helps with PVP, since on the server melons and soups are insta eat they cost a certain amount of stamina so you can't tank and eat a ton of melons to survive pvp. 
==='''Blacksmithy'''===
Blacksmithy changes the way most people use anvils a lot. To repair an item you have to have some of what that item is made of and the item in your hotbar, the do /repair, but be careful you want to grind you blacksmithy before you repair diamond and iron sutff because you have a good chance to damage your item when you begin.

Mace Sword is a former moderator and mercenary who is the subject of a failed super soldier project. Mace works for the griefer organisation known as [[LAVA]]

== Moderator description[[Category:Players]] ==
Mace Sword was once a dedicated moderator, known to always follow the rules and when he had to catch a griefer, he never gave up until the griefer was caught. Mace was a famed and highly decorated moderator in the city server and was well respected. Mace used an iron sword as his weapon of choice. 

=== Project Golden Apple ===
One day, Mace Sword volunteered to be one of 15 test subjects for the super soldier project known as Project Golden Apple. However, Mace was the only one of the 15 test subjects to survive the project and received Strength II, Regeneration II, Resistance, Fire Resistance and Swiftness II for an infinity amount of time, but had a period of insanity and killed 5 moderators, which lead to the project being abandoned and Mace was discharged as a moderator for killing 5 moderators.

== Becoming a mercenary and working for LAVA ==
After his discharge, Mace Sword became a mercenary, using his abilities to his advantage as well as an emerald sword. As his first ever mercenary contract, Mace Sword was contracted to kill moderator Wood11 by LAVA, a griefer organisation for 10 000 emeralds. Mace accepted and, using his enchantments to his advantage, was able to get through Wood11's guards with ease and killed Wood11.

=== Description ===
After his first contract, Mace continued to work for LAVA, with his main employer being [[NyanCat]], as a mercenary, using his enchantments to his advantage. In just 3 years, Mace earned a reputation as the deadliest mercenary. Mace has killed moderators and admins for 13 years on the behalf of LAVA, including famed moderator Axe48. Mace is now wanted in different servers, including the city server. Mace will only accept contracts if the pay meets his standards.  He will not only accept pay in the form of diamonds, gold or emeralds, but will also accept paymant in the form of rare weapons to add to his collection of rare minecraft weapons.

== Weapons ==
[[Category:Stories]][[Category:Players]]
Mace Sword's collection of weapons include an emerald sword, a diamond bow and diamond arrows, emerald throwing knives, a mini crossbow pistol that fires darts laced with poison IV, TNT grenades and poison V gas bombs, all of which are rare to find in minecraft</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1479">Malcolm Village was [[Eagle flame369|Eagle flame369's]] hometown, where he grew up during his childhood.

==Description==

The village was relatively small, but not to small. It had a church, and a couple of houses on one street, and the other street had two more houses and a library.

==Story==

Malcolm Village was founded a long time ago, by Sir Malcolm the Great, who was a knight of Ulthor, who was the old king of Minecraftia. For generations the Village went without destruction, guarded by Guards, and Sir Malcolm's descendants. eagle_flame369 and his friend, tpb1623, were born in this village, and were two of the few survivors of Herobrine's attack.
==Destruction==
On Friday night, Herobrine received news that the Hero an ancient prophecy spoke about (eagle_flame369) and one of his companions (tpb1623) lived in the village, so Herobrine ordered an attack on the village. The next night, on Saturday, the zombies invaded the village. Several warriors, including Didimaki (eagle_flame369's dad) tried to fight back, but it was no use. The village was destroyed and burnt down, and several villagers were either dead or infected. There were only a few survivors, including eagle_flame369, tpb1623, and their families.
==Trivia==
*It is unknown what happened to eagle's mother and tpb's family, because eagle and tpb moved to PAS Village, and Didimaki became the lord of another village.

==Biography==
Persson started programming at the age of seven, using his dad's Commodore 128. He produced his first game (a text-adventure) at the age of eight, with the help of type-in programs. In 2005 he started working as a game developer for King.com, which he left in 2009 to work as a programmer at Jalbum. After Minecraft sales grew he moved from full time to part time at Jalbum and then eventually left to focus full time on Minecraft in June 2010, many of the Mojang employees (including CEO Carl Manneh) are also ex-Jalbum employees. Outside of work he frequently takes part in competitions, including Ludum Dare, LD12 and the Java 4K Game Programming Contest. He lived in Denmark before he moved to Sweden with his parents and went to school there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size=1&gt;Taken from the [http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Notch Minecraft Wiki.]&lt;/font&gt;
==Current Work==
Persson is currently creating an alternate-reality space game, currently released as'' 0x10&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;''. It has not even entered Alpha, but will most likely ''not'' resemble Minecraft in the slightest.

'''Mega2098''', better known as &quot;Sharple&quot;, is an adventurer in the [[Realm of Jolvo]] and enjoys to hunt his prey in the dark. Sharple skills include: Parkour, crafting, building, owning, and (most importantly) pwning.
==Early Age==
Sharple was borned on the [[Isle of Fruit]] on Minecraft version 1.0.0. During his early ages, he was taught parkour and sword fighting by his father. Sharple's father was a blacksmith, and crafted the most inexpensive equipment in the [[Realm of Jolvo]]. Taking advantage of his education, he began to set off for his own adventure when he reached the age of 16. Most of his childhood he was isolated because of how shy he was around newcomers and never fit into the pie the right way. At the age of 15, his father mysteriously disappeared and his ill mother died in the same day his father disappeared.

Once he became 20 years old, he went to quest for more emralds and diamonds. He discovered the [[Legend of Isphael]], where this creature would kidnap and execute his victims, to acquire all of their items.


==Game==
Sharple began to learn how to hunt animals at the age of 25. He killed Red Panda and Tapir. His mentor was none other than the famous, Yu Su Ah Li. Sharple meant Li during one of his expeditions to the nether, where Li used his expertise in explosives to save Sharple's butt. His favorite book that inspired him to go hunting was ''The Most Dangerous Game,'' however, his favorite thing to hunt was cows. Cows were the number 1 thing that annoyed him the most, their constant moaning and they're useful leather just laying there on their body, waiting for a wolf to just munch on it. He always loved to take out the cow's heart and hold it up in the air and yell &quot;PEARS&quot;, one of his least favorite fruits.

My First minecraft day didn't go so well...
==Morning==
I finally gotten minecraft I was so excited. The first thing i did was punched a sheep and then felt like a boss. I walked about ten minecraft meters and then BAM I fell down a ravine I was like &quot;WHAT THE HELL&quot; and then encounter my first zombie. I freaked out so bad I exited minecraft and got a drink of water to replenish my thirst of the zombie. After that I opened minecraft up and then started to punch the zombie and still unaware of my surroundings I backed up to the wall and then the zombie almost killed me. Then I started to collect gravel and dirt (after I learned I had to hold on the right click on the mouse)then after my 1x1 tower I was proud of myself and said TAKE THAT BITCHES, it soon became noon.

==Afternoon==
I heard that you were suppose to survive your first night I did the complete opposite of that, instead of collecting wood I punched sheep and cows. Then I got finally bored and punch a tree out (LIKE A BOSS). Then I pressed &quot;E&quot; for the first time. Then I seen this little crafting area and so I putted the logs in their, Then these weird wooden planks appeared. After two intense moment of crafting a Crafting bench I decided I wanted to make a rocket.

==Nightfall==
It soon became night and me being unaware of it I made a dirt fort. This dirt fort wasn't just a plan noob fort It was RIGHT NEXT to a mountain and then my nightmares finally began to show. I went outside still unaware of the hostile mobs that roam across the blocks, there it was a green thing soon I realize that i was a creeper. I walked towards the green beings... it started hissing (I thought it was gonna rape me...) and then KABAM It exploded and then I raged quit...

==Eros==
Eros is a tamed tabby cat, that was once found in a jungle by [[Mega2098]]. Eros first spotted Mega when he was on a trip to the jungle. He was then confronted with Eros trying to hunt him for days. Mega finally capture Eros, and instead of eating Eros's heart he befriended the cat. They have been in-separated ever since.
==How he got his name.==
Mega2098, gave Eros the nickname &quot;Eros&quot; since his desire to capture the animal. Eros opened Mega's eyes after hunting him for several days. He realized that there is more than brunt-force. 

==&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:20px;&quot;&gt;Life Before meeting his owner.&lt;/span&gt;==


Before meeting him, Eros enjoyed hunting silverfish and chasing creepers around to get them teleported by Enderman. He would spy on players and feasted on their inventories.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2649">Minecraftia is in danger: it has been over two millennia since the great war, when the entire army of Him was unleashed for three thousand years. Since that time, Minecraftia has had peace with the neighboring dimension of the Nether and The End. But a new threat is rising. The Farlands have returned. And a new hero is needed to stop the threat.....

==Part 1: New Friends==
Steve woke up. He stretched his arms, and yawned, still incredibly tired.

Last night had been bad, very bad. Three creepers had destroyed the mine, causing the deaths of five miners. The village was still okay, though, and not one zombie had come anywhere near the place.

He got up, and checked his chest. Diamonds were still there, along with the Iron and Sticks. &quot; At least I can get to work on the armor.&quot; he said to himself.

He found the diamonds last night, before the creepers attacked the mine. &quot; Now where did I put my craf-&quot; he lost his train of thought when he saw what was outside. 

His crafting table was surrounded by TNT, which was surrounded by pressure plates. A sign was in the middle, on the crafting table.

Bolting outside, he read the sign: &quot;From: Pyroll. To; Steve. Guess what? If you want this thing, give me the diamonds.&quot;

&quot; Not again..&quot; Steve mumbled. Pyroll was the village troll, and quite a fail at that. The Admins didn't arrest him since he wasn't much of a threat. 

Breaking one of the Tnt, he set about getting his crafting table. &quot;Sure ain't that clever...&quot; He thought. &quot; This Pyroll.&quot; He glanced upwards just in time to see Pyroll`s troll-face staring at him. Pyroll was standing in front of the tnt tnt. Steve glanced at him. He gulped. In Pyroll`s hand was a flint and steel.

&quot;Surprise, mother-!&quot; Pyrolls words were cut as he lit the Tnt and ran.

&quot;NO!&quot; Steve cried, and ran as fast as he could from the tnt. A loud BOOM! Swiftly followed, with several more coming afterwards.&quot;Notch be damned.&quot; He growled. Pyroll was laughing his head off. &quot; Like it? I told you to give me your diamonds, but did you listen?&quot; Pyroll didn't wait for an answer. &quot;NOOO!&quot; His laughter continued. 

&quot;Pyroll, this time you`ve gone too far!&quot; Steve yelled. He charged at him, fist ready. &quot; Okay, Steve, You want this fight you... Yo.. What?&quot; Pyroll didn't finish his sentence. &quot;What is that?&quot; He asked. Steve stopped. He glared at him. &quot; Are you trying to-&quot;

He was pushed to the before he could finish by Pyroll. The next instant, a fireball flew over their heads.

==Part 2:Spiderkiller345==
Coming soon....

NOTE: I am fine if you want to suggest new characters for the story. i plan on attempting some collaborative fictions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1733">'''Miner260349 '''is a rookie at Minecraft, still learning the ways of his leader, and a harbinger, [[Dcomando15]]. Miner came from the desert world, south west. He then came to a small city, belonging to the infamous faction named Warriors, lead by the harbinger, Dcomando15. Miner earned his way into Warriors by the trust. He was sent into the Vikings faction and TNTed their town. And then to Japan, and TNTed the 1 man house, Davesdavy's, and succeeded along with the harbinger and second in command, Dirty Mallace. It is unknown where Miner has been though, he disappeared from Sky City before the server was terminated.

A letter from Miner was found in the old town where warriors lived, in the desert. It said &quot; Farewell my faction. My harbinger, and my friends. It has been a nice run. I have been trapped inside a cave where [[Herobrine]] lives. I took the liberty of sending this last letter to you by escaping before being tortured and captured again. If you are finding it, inform the harbinger that Herobrine is out to get everyone that once belonged to the Warriors. For he is coming. May Almighty God be with you at this time. He will snatch you up like a hawk and take you to the bedrock like a serpent. Herobrine has already broken both of my legs and tortured me to nearly to the point of death, he found me wandering where you are right now. Whatever you do, do not leave Sky City. The surface is practically hunting ground. I have to go now, I can hear him coming back from hunting.

                                                        Farewell and always.

A '''Mole Creeper''' is a Creeper, but with heightened intelligence and special abilities that other Creepers lack.

== &lt;font color=&quot;limegreen&quot;&gt;Background &lt;/font&gt; ==


&lt;font color=&quot;limegreen&quot;&gt;The first Mole Creeper was created in one of [[Parax]]'s labs approximately 5,000 years prior to his arrival in the land known as Olex. He genetically engineered the Creeper to have different capabilities, including heightened intelligence, digging, mining, hand to hand (or in the Creeper's case, feet or head) combat, and regeneration after exploding. After creating it, he released it out into the wild and let it take its course. This Creeper traveled to many lands&amp;mdash;including Olex, several thousand years later&amp;mdash;and proceeded to reproduce with the population, leading to the birth of an entirely new subspecies: Mole Creepers. The same Mole Creeper that Parax created eventually came to Olex several months after its creator's own arrival. Since then, it has become a terror to those it encountered. &lt;/font&gt;

== &lt;font color=&quot;limegreen&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;limegreen&quot;&gt;Biology &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; ==


&lt;font color=&quot;limegreen&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;limegreen&quot;&gt;Mole Creepers, like the original brand of Creepers, are sentient creatures. Like any other Creeper, they walk on four legs, stand approximately 5'6&quot;, and possess skin with a feeling similar to dead leaves. Essentially, they appear as a Creeper at first&amp;mdash;specifically, Charged Creepers. However, they possess abilities that other Creepers do not have. For example, they are capable of digging and mining, storing what they dug or mined in an unseen inventory. Like any other Creeper, a Mole Creeper is capable of exploding (albeit as a last resort), though the explosion is larger. However, Mole Creepers have a trait that horrifies all their victims: regeneration after exploding. This makes tricking them into suicide ineffective, as the Mole Creeper will resurrect itself shortly after. This makes ''actual fighting'' the only effective way of killing a Mole Creeper. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

== &lt;font color=&quot;limegreen&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;limegreen&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;limegreen&quot;&gt;Warfare &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; ==


&lt;font color=&quot;limegreen&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;limegreen&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;limegreen&quot;&gt;Mole Creepers have easily recognized ways of hunting or killing their prey. Such methods include blunt force, beating victims with their feet or heads, biting, exploding, and most famously, digging the ground out from under their victims. These methods, most of them not being employed by other Creepers, make Mole Creepers very dangerous opponents, especially their digging and mining skills. They are also known to strip important resources from the surrounding areas of their prey, effectively causing economic turmoil in communities or starving others to death. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;limegreen&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;limegreen&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;limegreen&quot;&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
== &lt;font color=&quot;limegreen&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;limegreen&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;limegreen&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;limegreen&quot;&gt;Trivia &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; ==

*&lt;font color=&quot;limegreen&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;limegreen&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;limegreen&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;limegreen&quot;&gt;Some Mole Creepers will appear as normal Creepers instead of the usual appearance of Charged Creepers. However, these aren't technically &quot;natural&quot;, and were genetically engineered to gain the intelligence and abilities of the natural ones.&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;limegreen&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;limegreen&quot;&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3400">==[[File:Cookie.png|thumb|Monster Cookie]] Origin==
The Monster Cookie is an odd sort of mob that was created when Dirtman(AKA AwesomeA321's) Uncle was trying to make a living cookie friend for his cookie craving nephew. The cookie was fused with the DNA and mind of a player. However, the player did not know that the experiment they had volunteered for would go so wrong, but they still didn't feel all too pleasant about it in the first place. When the experiment was over, the cookie had eyes and a mouth, but it was not alive. So, the uncle extracted life essence from a spider, which made the cookie hostile, but it was still alive. It immediately killed the uncle, and found the a picture of DirtMan and his family in the uncle's house. It then set off with one goal; Kill the family.

It took many years for the Monster Cookie to find Dirtman. So long, in fact, that Dirtman's family had either split up or passed before it found one family member: Dirtman's Parents' cat. It fought it in an epic battle, but was beaten and bruised at the end of the battle, and the cat had won. While the cat pranced away, an odd ghost-like entity known as &quot;[[Herobrine]]&quot; had come up and taken the cookie. It had fainted after the battle, awoke chained to a metal bed. Herobrine came up, and pulled a lever while the Cookie stared in fear at his eerie figure. As Herobrine pulled the lever, the bed rose up and was lifted through a hole in the roof, where it was then struck by red lightning. It then felt powerful, more than anything in the world. When it was lowered down to ground level, it broke free of its chains, and looked around. No one was there, not even Herobrine. It then ran off and through a wall. It thought it heard &quot;Be free, my creation&quot; come from the abandoned building, but it hadn't time to look back. It then chose to hunt down the youngest from the family, Dirtman (AwesomeA321) himself.

The monster cookie searched far and wide, until it finally started to find a trail. It noticed that wherever the thing went, he affected it. He made villagers act odd, he made creepers calm, but they were hostile towards others. Soon, it found him. He was just mining underneath a cliffside and had taken a break to eat a '''cookie'''. The monster, using its powers given by Herobrine, had duplicated and it itself had grown to about 6 blocks high. It then went on and chased Dirtman. Dirtman ran very quickly, and was scared of what would happen. The Cookie's clones came and jumped on Dirtman, and held him down. He tried to eat them, but they avoided every one of his attempts. He was approached by the tall Monster. The cookie leaned forward and, with one big GULP, swallowed him right up. Fortunately for Dirtman, he had a large stomach, so he could eat a lot, so Dirtman ended up eating his way out. Dirtman then pulled out a shovel and dug a hole beneaththe cookie. He then built over it, and left before the duplicates could fight him.
==Basic Info==
The cookie monster rarely spawns, but when he does, he is very large and powerful. He is only vulnerable to TNT and dirt, as this is his worst fear ever since being defeated by Dirtman. He has 20 hearts and once he dies, he splits into a group of 7 miniature cookies. He is hostile and will attac on sight. When his miniature duplicates are killed, they usually drop cookies and diamonds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="860">Morocco was a 2012 POTCOPlayers original server faction, under the command of Peter Coalvane ([[Funnyguy651]]). Though it met a devastating end due to the fact that it had become a target, as it was so powerful, it's accomplishments as a faction go heavily underestimated. This is their story.


==The Beginning==

==Mallace arrives==
On March 23rd 2012, upon the advice of [[user:DanGames|John Breasly (Dcomando15)]] Mallace purchased minecraft and began playing. As he first joined the original server, he was trolled by dukerowns you and [[DAVESDAVY]]. It wasn't until finally, Peter, who actually had a heart, offered him a small apartment in Morocco in exchange for labor, he began love to the game. Working as a cobble miner, Mallace quickly climbed the ranks and became great friends with Peter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="774">'''Mycelia''' is a small area located in the center of Angmar and is generally accepted to be the coldest and highest point in northern Minecraftia. Some could call it a small town or village, though its residents are quite oblivious to visitors. The hike up to Mycelia is especially treacherous, as there are no paths for wagons or carriages. It snows frequently and is almost always covered in a blanket of snow. Mycelia is known for its Mycelium patches and Soul and pits, and the only sights you will see here are abandoned dungeons, cabins, the residence of the Baron, and Mycelium Manor.

The only signs of life are the spiders who live in Soul sand pits, the occasional hooded man, and the sounds of dangerous experiments coming from the manor.

== Griefer description ==
Mynlas founded The TNT Griefer Organization in 1.7.2. Mynlas wears a gentleman's suit and speaks with an English accent. What makes Mynlas so dangerous is that he appears to be a harmless player who wouldn't grief at all, but in reality, he is a psychopath who enjoys griefing servers with his TNT. Mynlas is so notorious, head admins on the servers he's griefed have sentenced him to instant ban.[[Category:Players]]

http://www.scetch.net/ (Official website of Nodus's creator)}}''Nodus'' is a hacked client created by Scetch. It consists of a collection of mods which are aimed to aid players in their griefing. The client is popular among griefers, but bigger griefing teams, such as Team Avolition and iCanHasGrief develop their own clients. You can view their griefing adventures on YouTube.

When installed, the mod menu can be opened by pressing Y by default. The most used mods include: KillAura, FullBright, XRay, NoFall, FastBreak, and Fly. Some mods can be edited by the user through the console which can be accessed using U by default. The XRay mod can be configured to show any blocks the user desires, just by typing &quot;xray add &lt;block ID&gt;&quot; into the console 

As of 1.5.2, the original Nodus has been discontinued because Scetch though that the community had become too toxic. After Scetch stepped down as developer of the client, he donated Nodus to wizardhax.com. With Nodus now owned by Wizardhax, a minecraft user by the name of SirJava has resumed developent of Nodus. Finally in the summer of 2014 Wizardhax unveiled Nodus 2.0, developed by SirJava.[[Category:Mods]]</text>

==The Story of Notch==
Notch was the single being in the bare world. He was always there, but dormant. But he was bored with the normal, round world, being confined to the thin crust of a molten sphere. He dreamed of a world made up of blocks, a world where the only limit was your imagination. Flat, forever expanding.

With a little bit of help, he created this world, and named his creation &quot;Minecraft.&quot; He became a god-like being, known today simply as Notch.
==Appearance==
Notch's &quot;skin&quot; is currently a Caucasian man with a black goatee, wearing a brown t-shirt, grey pants, and black boots. He sports a cape with the &quot;Mojang&quot; symbol. He is known to randomly visit some servers, and appear at large functions. If he is killed (which is ''not'' advised, as he will get you back somehow) he will drop an apple for you.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1077">'''''Introduction'''''

Hello! My name is Octonocto7 (AKA Octo Nocto). I am currently a small youtube channel with a Minecraft server.

'''octoworld.zapto.org:21666'''

[http://octoworld.com My server website]

'''''Little-Known facts about me'''''

•I always seek company, but only from one person. Only applies to games. I am too popular in reality... :(

•I LOVE to cheat on games with mods (E.g: Minecraft, Terraria, Garry's Mod) And I never cheat on games that don't allow mods (E.g: Team Fortress 2).

•I always yearn to become a ghost and believe I shall be one some day.                         

•87% of the time I play games I play music.



'''''Youtube'''''

As you read in the Introduction, I have a youtube channel.

Its name is [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0kIz65e-x4qegD72V1-i8w Octo Nocto.]

Sorry about the No-Upload thing. I will try to upload more.



'''That's all, folks!'''

This is all I really want to tell you about myself. Thank you for reading this, It tooks me about 30 minutes...

:)

Bye!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="669">The '''Orderdale Church''' has been around since the early 1920s in minecraft. It is located in [[Canadia]]. The church has since been abandoned in 1967. Ever since the great freeze that started forming in 1966-1969 This church has been frozen over and used to be surrounded by many rolling hills and grassy fields.

He is... Lime wool, with a black ninja bandana, and default &quot;Steve's eyes.&quot; He is either seen wearing diamond armor, or nothing. His advantage is the sword, doing Crits almost every time he attacks. He tends to avoid pvp servers, but uses it when needed. Sometimes, when a sword is not available he can use a bow. The downside is that he can only shoot down-hill/ shooting in the down direction.[[File:2012-08-06_16.58.02.png|thumb|330px|Blockin'!]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3193">'''POTCO '''is a player faction currently operating out of the Creatures Server. It was founded by ViceroyRobert on the evening of July 27th, 2014. However, he quickly handed over leadership of the faction to [[Cannonwalker]] and made a sister faction named '''Reagent''' (due to the original name of the faction being '''Catalysis''') and the faction was renamed by Cannonwalker and Ned_Edgewalker to TheNewBrood. A day later, Cannonwalker handed the faction over to [[Ned_Edgewalker]], but remained with the group. Shortly after, the factions fourth and final name, POTCO was decided upon.
==History==
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;&quot;&gt;''Under Construction''&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;&quot;&gt;On the evening of July 27th, 2014, Cannonwalker and four other members of Elitecraft's [http://mcplayers.wikia.com/wiki/Templars_(Faction) Templars] went to a server known as the &quot;Creatures Server.&quot; These members were [http://mcplayers.wikia.com/wiki/Andrew_%22Petrova%22_Mallace Dirty_Mallace/AugustPetrova], [http://mcplayers.wikia.com/wiki/Parax BaronVonShush], [http://mcplayers.wikia.com/wiki/Ned_Edgewalker Ned_Edgewalker] and ViceroyRobert. ViceroyRobert founded a faction known then as &quot;TheWikians,&quot; although he soon changed it to &quot;Catalysis.&quot; Robert then left to make his own ally sister faction known as &quot;Reagent.&quot; He left Cannonwalker in charge of Catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;

Cannonwalker, Ned and Baron set out from spawn to find a place to set up. However, they almost immediately encountered another player's castle. The castle looked like it had been attacked by enemies, and they saw an opportunity to loot. They stole various crops, mushrooms, cobblestone, redstone, coal, and various other things from the place. They then pressed onwards.

Baron, Ned and Cannonwalker climbed up and crossed a wooden platform, which led them to a mountain. It was night time and they were beginning to get hungry, so Baron planted what little carrots they had left in a nearby pond and Cannonwalker began construction on a house. When morning was reached, Cannonwalker constructed a more permanent settlement. In the day to come, [http://mcplayers.wikia.com/wiki/Rocket_93 Rocket_93] would also join the faction.

In the afternoon of July 28th, Rocket began hoarding the New Brood's supplies in a nearby ravine. When he got everything he wanted, he left the faction and fled. Cannonwalker and Baron attempted to chase him down, but to no evail. Cannonwalker, distraught that yet another faction he was in was weakened by a traitor, gave leadership of the faction to Ned_Edgewalker and left. However, Ned convinced Cannonwalker to return. Ned, Cannonwalker and Squirto then decided to rename the faction &quot;POTCO,&quot; as &quot;TheNewBrood&quot; was only meant to be a temporary name. Among all of the chaos, Dirty_Mallace/AugustPetrova departed the faction for [[DAVESDAVY]]'s faction, and former Templars member, [[Squirto19]], joined the faction.

'''Parax''' is the true name of an entity who frequently travels across Minecraftia. He is known for several notable creations and destructive tendencies.

== &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Biography&lt;/font&gt; ==


Parax appears as a jet-black being with red eyes and dark robes. He has tendencies to wander from the mainland of the server, going on adventures for exotic items. He enjoys blowing things up, setting buildings on fire, and stalking people across the server. He makes frequent travels to the Nether and the End in search of items to sell to the highest bidder.


== &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;History &lt;/font&gt; ==


&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;When Parax first came to the Sharplean Sector, he was greeted by [[AwesomeA321]], and took on the alias &quot;Baron Von Shush&quot; to blend in with the community. AwesomeA321, whom Parax came to know as &quot;David&quot;, helped the latter get settled in with the sector. When David went out to run errands, Parax began to explore the sector, racking up money and searching for a place to live. David helped Parax find a home in the mountains, near the house of Josef Furnace, whom Parax later referred to as &quot;Slappy&quot;. Parax and David began building the former a house, with Parax eventually building a mine across from it to acquire resources. Within hours, the house was complete with the combined effort of Parax, David, and [[Rocket_93|Pencil]]. &lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Parax proceeded to build up his friendships with the other residents of the Sharplean Sector before going off on yet another journey. He traveled for several days, acquiring countless items before coming across a canyon. Parax proceeded to surround it with a sea of lava before beginning the construction of what he believes to be his &quot;empire&quot;. &lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Parax traveled between the canyon and his home countless times, bringing supplies to the hidden area. During his travels, he often came across buildings. Parax proceeded to light the buildings on fire, leaving behind messages signed with his new alias, &quot;the Baron&quot;. He used this as a scare tactic to keep people away from the canyon, keeping it hidden. &lt;/font&gt;

== &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;The Templars &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; ==


&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Soon into the creation of his empire, Parax joined the [[The Templars of Minecraftia|Templars]]. He quickly rose through the ranks, becoming one of the lords. After conquering vast amounts of land, the Templars set sail for more land. There, they came across a continent known as &quot;Sully&quot;. The Templars established a base that increased in size within days. Not even a week passed and the Templars were already rivaling the strongest clan of Sully, Bloodline. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;In order to prosper and conquer, the Templars set up plans to conquer Bloodline. Their meeting adjourned and their plans into action, 3 of the Templar Lords&amp;mdash;Parax, Josef Furnace, and Pencil&amp;mdash;lured several members of Bloodline into a trap. They met up in Bloodline's own territory for a trade agreement, with Parax and Pencil waiting on the roofs of the buildings. With the signal given, Parax and Pencil leaped from their hiding places, ambushing the Bloodline members and killing them to lower the faction's power. They then looted whatever they could and raised the Templar flag on a captured building. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;The next day, unfortunately, Bloodline craved revenge. They attacked the Templar base and blew it up, but their victory was short-lived. Parax, intolerant of what happened, used threats that there are far stronger forces out there willing to destroy all of Sully on the divine being's orders. When the ruler of Sully, WazzUpp, did not believe Parax, the latter showed what he was capable of, convincing the former to have the Templar base restored. The workers sent to rebuild the base were then executed to ensure secrecy and prevent them from giving out the layout. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;gallery type=&quot;slideshow&quot;&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;The base restored, the Templars resumed their usual activities. Unfortunately, Zamokucevic, &quot;Zamo&quot;&amp;mdash;a resident of Sully and a member of Bloodline&amp;mdash;made wild claims about the base having stolen items, seeing this as a chance to improve his own image. This led to Wazz intruding onto the base and confiscating nearly everything the Templars rightfully acquired. Zamo continued to influence those of higher authority in Sully, desperately trying to create a negative image of the Templars. This worked in Zamo's favor. As a result, the Templars marched into the Bloodline territory and set their towns alight. All residents and those loyal to Bloodline were slaughtered in the attack. Few enemies remained: Zamo, Wazz, several surviving members of Bloodline, and a longtime resident of the Sharplean Sector, codenamed &quot;Funnyguy&quot;, who served as a mercenary. This lead to a final battle, leaving only Funnyguy, Zamo, and Wazz surviving. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;The Templars pretended to retreat to their base, luring the last surviving members of Bloodline to it. The 3 attempted to pound the steel door down, but the Templars opened it themselves, unleashing attack dogs and Iron Golems on them. Funnyguy and Wazz were trampled, while Zamo made his way into the base. While searching for the Templars, Zamo was kicked down a staircase by Parax, who then attempted to slash him with his sword. Zamo narrowly avoided the attack, drew his blade, and the two dueled. During the fight, Zamo was pushed into the base's End Portal and followed by Parax. Shortly after, Zamo was killed. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;The continent of Sully conquered, Templar bases were set up everywhere and the last of Bloodline's supporters were wiped out. The Templars were set up to govern the land, while the lords returned to their home base in the Sharplean Sector. It was at this point that they discovered Funnyguy to be alive, albeit shunned by the Templars and their supporters. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;At some point, dozens of zombie pigmen inhabiting the Nether attempted a rebellion against the Templars. Equipping his bow and a single stack of arrows, Parax took down the zombie pigmen, clearing the Nether of all hostiles and restoring Templar control. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;It was no secret that Parax had summoned a Wither outside his home. In time, he managed to domesticate the creature, making it serve him and him only. It was named &quot;the Dark One&quot; and now resides in a glass building in Parax's yard. He proceeded to conduct more experiments regarding Withers, using them as biological weapons for the Templars. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;

[[File:Josef possessed.png|left|200px|thumb|Josef, possessed by Herobrine.]] &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

== &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Herobrine &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; ==


&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Shortly into Parax's experiments, the Templars began to set up a city in Angmar. Using his wealth earned from his exotic journeys and experiments, Parax was able to help fund the construction of the city, as well as the gargantuan wall surrounding it. Oddly enough, a storm swept across the city, and countless monsters poured into it. Parax and Josef observed the unnatural storm from the former's house, when a ghostly entity suddenly appeared. The two dueled the creature,&quot;Herobrine&quot;, who pushed Parax off his balcony. Josef was left to fight the beastie alone, though Herobrine used his superior power and fighting to overpower him. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Parax climbed back up to his house, finding Josef barely able to fight off Herobrine, who was constantly teleporting around him and attacking. Parax, wielding his blade, rushed in and tackled the ghostly entity, but Herobrine suddenly disappeared. He turned to Josef to see if he was okay, only to see his friend and ally fidgeting, eyes glowing white. Josef uttered, &quot;Die&quot; to Parax and tackled him off his house, with the two narrowly missing the flaming &quot;Parax&quot; in the latter's front yard. The two dueled, and Parax unwillingly mortally wounded him. Josef attempted to flee, prompting Parax to chase him down. By the time Josef had gotten to an abandoned Apeture town, Parax had leaped from a nearby building's roof, stabbing his Grandmaster. Herobrine flew from Josef's dying body and grabbed Parax, taking him to the top of his house once again. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;The two fought furiously, but Herobrine was slowly gaining the upper hand. Desperate to win, Parax tackled Herobrine, slashing and punching angrily for the loss of Josef. Herobrine kicked Parax off, picked up his own sword, and pinned him to the ground with his foot. Before he could stab Parax, a heavily bleeding Josef stabbed Herobrine from behind. The ghost shrieked and disappeared in a cloud of smoke.[[File:Herobrine flees.png|right|200px|thumb|The possessed Josef flees.]] &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;With Herobrine's defeat, an organic statue was left in his place on top of Parax's home, and a copy of his head dropped to Josef's feet. Josef fell to his knees, dying, but the rest of the Templars came to his aid. Josef was placed on his bed, and the Templars slowly brought him back to health with Potions of Healing. After Josef's recovery, the copy of Herobrine's head was claimed and promptly put on display to show the might of the Templars. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Days passed. A storm covered Angmar, focusing the most over the statue of Herobrine. Lightning struck the city constantly, forcing the residents into hiding, though some were not fast enough, and were incinerated. When the storm ended, Herobrine's statue was gone. While this made the Templars nervous, they remained determined to stopping Herobrine's reign. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Shortly after the disappearance of the statue, signs with ominous messages began appearing throughout the Sharplean Sector, and one-page books with fractions of a sentence were being left throughout the Templar city. Additionally, residents of the city were disappearing mysteriously. This led to Parax making it a goal to solve this mystery and stop Herobrine. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

== &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Sorel &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; ==


&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Parax had set off on yet another adventure, packing what he deemed essential before temporarily departing Olex. In doing so, he came across the land known to the residents as &quot;Gabeworld&quot;, which was currently a warzone. When he arrived, he encountered his old friend, retired Templar, and fellow resident of Olex, Pencil. Pencil immediately recruited Parax into his group, known as &quot;Sorel&quot;. Many residents of Gabeworld had been at war with a man who went by the name of &quot;Dante&quot;. Dante had been utilizing the help of various criminals for resources, which he had been using in hopes of self-profit and eventually taking over the land. After a number of political schemes, Sorel drove Dante from Gabeworld, and the residents began to rebuild from the destruction he caused. Parax decided to remain in Gabeworld for a bit longer, hoping to learn from the residents, document his adventures, and perhaps profit from his extended stay. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;It wasn't too long after Dante's departure when two more factions began to take on destructive tendencies. These factions were known as &quot;Pigmen&quot;&amp;mdash;named after the zombified residents of the Nether&amp;mdash;and the United Societies of Ascendancy&amp;mdash;an international group bent on dominance. Both factions had planned to wipe out Sorel in hopes of eliminating one of the few threats to their plot to conquer Gabeworld. By this point, Parax been excessively writing in his journal to document his adventures in Gabeworld; despite having a photographic memory, Parax planned to give the journal to Pencil so that the tales of his travels would live on. He recorded Pigmen and the United Societies' activities in his journal, writing down their battle tactics and keeping evidence of their plans to share with the other residents of Gabeworld. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;In time, the Pigmen faction was destroyed, leaving the United Societies without allies. Still limited in resources due to being relatively new, the leader&amp;mdash;known as Jacob Facultas, personally came to Gabeworld in hopes of negotiating to increase his influence. Facultas quickly used his forces to weaken and enslave the faction Aurora, forcing its members to provide the United Societies with hard-earned resources in exchange for their lives. Once again, Sorel stepped in and declared war on the United Societies. Parax, hearing the news, got into his Legionary form to match the situation of war, and fetched a diamond sword thad he had been working on since his arrival to Gabeworld. The group secretly assassinated the members of the United Societies, widdling away at their ranks one-by-one. Tactics that Sorel used included random assaults, stealthy assassinations, and staged peace treaties, which only ended in the deaths of any United Societies members present. After killing off the members of the United Societies, the organization's presence in Gabeworld collapsed, and Facultas fled the land, barely surviving with his life, and leaving behind everything he brought to Gabeworld behind. Parax would later write down this battle in his journal. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Unfortunately, Gabeworld began to run low on resources, forcing most of the residents to abandon the settled land and travel to new parts of the sector. Parax was one of those who left in search of resources, packing up his most valuable possessions before departing. For reasons unknown, he made it a goal to get to the Nether after he settles; he would then locate a Nether Fortress and use it as his base of operations.
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;
Soon into his adventures in Gabeworld, Parax located a Nether Fortress, and set up shop there. He created a hidden portal that led directly to the fortress, and kept all items in there, and within days, successfully established his company's presence in Gabeworld. All items were stored there, and given a special form of security to prevent raiding. As for the fortress, it received similar security, preventing intruders from entering. With his base of operations set up, Parax began his next plan: acquiring large sums of money in order to aide the company even further in its goals.
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

== &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Reyes &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; ==


&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Some time after peace being restored to Gabeworld, Parax went on a temporary leave from the land, later journeying to a land known as &quot;Reyes&quot; to the residents. Parax settled in by traveling to a village and claiming ownership of an abandoned house. Apparently, the village was constantly suffering from zombie attacks every night; in an attempt to counteract the zombie raids, Parax began researching them. After acquiring cows and chickens for food, Parax set up a lab under the village. In this lab, he captured several zombies and hostile zombie pigmen and locked them in various, categorized cells - one zombie alone, one pigman alone, zombies in groups, pigmen in groups, zombies and pigmen in groups, as well as a zombie spawner&amp;mdash;a cage-like item that summons the undead. He documented his experiences and research carefully, even using live villagers as test subjects, but complaints of &quot;odd, disturbing sounds&quot; by the residents forced Parax to relocate his experiments deeper underground, underneath the village's well. After studying the behavior of the undead menaces, Parax suggested the implementation of iron golems and a wall around the village. Parax waited a while after installing his suggested form of security, and left the village to pursue other goals in Reyes after the test became a success. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Sometime into his travels on Reyes, Parax encountered former Olex resident, whom he had nicknamed &quot;Garric&quot;. Garric, whose true name was Geirstein Jarlsskald had been traveling the land in search of an old Viking town he used to live in. Parax began to travel with Geirstein to help him search for the town, which they eventually came across. This town, &quot;Husavik&quot;, welcomed Geirstein back home with open arms, and eventually came to accept Parax, who took on the alias &quot;Thorstein Austrani&quot; to fit in with the residents. The town had, unfortunately, lost much of its territory to environmental disasters, resulting Jarlsskald and Austrani tasking themselves to rebuild what was lost.

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Unfortunately, Husavik was still in a weakened state when yet another saddening event occurred; a rival clan launched an attack on Husavik, destroying the majority of the buildings. Few residents survived, including Austrani prized horse, &quot;Lord Bulbo&quot;, whom he had become very fond of from countless jousting tournaments; Austrani had never lost a match with the prized horse, even when faced with seemingly-impossible odds. Austrani and Jarlsskald, using their leadership abilities, got set to rebuilding Husavik&amp;mdash;and getting revenge on the raiders that left it in pieces.



[[File:Par's tree.png|left|200px|thumb|Parax finds himself a new home.]] &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

== &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;New discoveries &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; ==


&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;During one of Parax's exotic journeys, he located an unnamed, highly advanced stretch of land. After receiving a warm greeting by the residents, Parax set up a temporary home underneath the village. After capturing chickens and storing them in a pen, he dug underground and found a cave system; there, he acquired numerous ores, many of which he did not recognize, as well as objects known as &quot;shards&quot; - powerful, element-infused objects that could be used as power sources. He stored his new findings in a chest, planning to study them. However, superstitious residents of the village began to question Parax's presence; some believed him to be the cause of unexplained events regarding zombie attacks and numerous explosions, the latter being a result of Parax's experimenting with the newly-found resources. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;As a result of the paranoid villagers, Parax gathered up as much food as he could, packed up the numerous crystals, ores, shards, and household objects, and left his underground lair, traveling for a day before settling in a large tree in a jungle. During one of his travels around the land for resources, he was greeted by one of the residents, Matthew, who gave him a book known as a &quot;Thaumonomican&quot;. This book automatically updated itself with information whenever Parax made a discovery, and provided methods for creating various objects&amp;mdash;new methods will be unlocked in the book as it updates. After learning that to start a chain of new research, he would need to create a wand, Parax got set to locating a source of gold&amp;mdash;a difficult task, given the land's low amounts of it.
[[File:Par Thaumonomican.png|right|200px|thumb|Parax becomes curious about his Thaumonomican.]] &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;A few days into his settling, Parax began to dig deeper, coming across an abandoned mineshaft. Through excessive exploration and fighting off the various undead and spiders living in the mine, Parax managed to find large amounts of gold. He excitedly documented the experience in his journal as he mined the vast amounts of resources in the mineshaft, and later used the gold he found to create a wand. However, it was in its basic form, and thus Parax required more knowledge of what he was dealing with in order to upgrade it. Nonetheless, he made several other discoveries with the help of the wand, and made his next goal the acquisition of diamonds&amp;mdash;through diamond tools, he could mine obsidian and create a Nether Portal, as several Nether-exclusive resources were needed to construct more magic-related items. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

Such examples include: &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

===&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;The Baron&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;===


&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;[[File:The Baron.png|left|200px|thumb|The Baron]]Only a few weeks after his introduction to the land of Olex, Parax took on &quot;The Baron&quot; as one of his many titles. At this point, he wears a black hoodie with a Creeper face on the back, and speaks with a sarcastic attitude. He also is known to be constantly cracking jokes when using this alter ego, and is in general a joyful person. In addition, he is very adventurous and often will investigate random events. For example, when unfortunate events happen, such as a death in Olex or the destruction of someone's property, he immediately rushes to the area. Even if the matter is not major, he once again shows a minor amount of humor by setting up yellow tape around the area and placing iron golems around while he &quot;investigates&quot;. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;[[File:Parax the Jägermeister.png|left|200px|thumb|The Jägermeister]]When using this alter ego, Parax wears what appears to be the uniform of a Hessian Jäger, albeit darker. His skills in tracking and out in the wild are increased, and he will usually speak in a German accent. When someone is asleep, he will often put signs around them praising the Jägermeister or warning them that the &quot;Jägermeister is coming&quot;, again showing a form of humor. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

He wears a Sam Browne-styled belt (albeit over the left shoulder instead of the right)equipped with knives, and a long sword sheathed at the side of his belt. Other notable gear include a fox head that he wears as a hood, and a pair of sunglasses, making his glowing eyes dimmer. While wearing this, Parax is far more aggressive, sarcastic, tactical in combat, and highly confident. He also makes a habit of referring to his enemies as &quot;profligates&quot; or &quot;degenerates&quot;, as well as countless other derogatory terms that relate to savagery/uncivilization. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

In addition to this, he sports a medium-sized beard and Sam Browne-styled belt, the former of which he is quite proud of; he constantly refers to the beard as &quot;glorious&quot;. Furthermore, this version of Parax has an aggressive personality, and has a heavy, stereotypical addiction to mead, despite his inability to get drunk. He also wields a sharpened cane with a diamond head; the cane, referred to as his &quot;pimpcane&quot;, has notable abilities, such as excellent cutting, the power to set enemies on fire, and the ability to electrocute his enemies. He will spontaneously shout that it is the power of Thor while shocking his enemies.

This sword is known as Frozen Legend the Second, named after the original sword that is in Albert's possession. Parax theorizes that this sword was a reward from Albert for helping him locate the original, which was lost for some time. In addition, he wields a sword of his own, titled &quot;Blade of Parax&quot;. This sword has many abilities, being sharp enough to cut through any type of alloy, set enemies on fire, and send them flying a considerable distance with one hit. Parax also has remarkable skills with the bow, firing arrows with deadly accuracy. Despite the many weapons at his disposal, Parax is mostly seen in combat with his fists or a sharpened stick, using the environment to his advantage. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

In the first few weeks of his time on Olex, Parax set an empty, unclaimed building on fire when he thought it was abandoned. He did not want the abandoned building to go to waste, so he attempted to make it look more &quot;scary&quot; to add to the effect of a mysterious island. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

Pixelrole is a fairly new Minecraft player. His real name is James Richardson, his skin is a storm trooper from the Star Wars franchise. He is well known for his Minecraft builds and an incredible technical ability

==Personality and Story==

Formerly a dimensional scientist employed by the dark side, Pixelrole was working on getting to a new dimension so the Empire (Led by the Emperor and commanded by Darth Vader) could collect resources safely. He and his team discovered Minecraftia, a completely new dimension with the same basic physics and concepts, but all made out of blocks. When the Death Star was destroyed, Pixelrole escaped death by jumping into the portal before it was annihilated. It is currently unknown if anybody else escaped through the portal, but the case study of the destruction of the satellite claimed it was 'very unlikely'.
Pixelrole is known for allot of incredible buildings that are created in Minecraft, most adopting the modern, slick style that was used to construct the Death Star. Many plea he puts his work on websites for the world, but there are no projects of his currently online.

==Writing and Proposed Shows==

[[File:DOE.png|thumb|The logo for DoE]]

It is rumored that Richardson is planning a series of his own called 'Days of Enderran'. The plot surrounds him entering a seed that has mysterious buildings. After reading a note from a long lost King of Enderran, it becomes clear that previously, another human who opened up the seed called 'Calgar', became a hacker and took over the once great Nation as its king. Pixelrole must battle Calgar and Herobrine with some help from friends in the Nation of Enderran and potentially some familiar faces from the Star Wars franchise.

Richardson has been considered for many script writing and directing roles outside of his own creations by the Minecraft fan-base. One is Shadow of Israphel, but Pixelrole said that there was 'an extremely slim chance'. Another is a lets play Minecraft series for Sky does Minecraft, but again he confirmed that it was also an unlikely possibility

The series is recorded, released, produced, and directed by Cyranno W. Kelbrid for COBC Gaming.
==Synopsis==




[https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/cyranno-kelbrid-webi.html CyrannoPlaysMC ]builds a city named Jamestown in an unnamed world code-named Planet Minecraft.

==Production==




The first season of Planet Minecraft was recorded and released with a screencasting app. They were released without a title sequence and in bad-to-good video and audio quality. They were (sometimes) narrated by [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/cyranno-kelbrid-webi.html Cyranno W. Kelbrid] himself, and they often didn't feature any music.

However, for the second part of Season 1, the series was given an official title sequence, as well as a soundtrack. Kelbrid was accompanied by his friend Abel Hernandez (Cubical Universe), and an entity named the &quot;Cyrannomat&quot;.

The quality of the series is meant to increase after the passing of the Creation Years of the COBC,
==Season 1 ([https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyEl4OXPIVcKYhirstzGcfGQ1P8rzETlu ▶️]) ([https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyEl4OXPIVcKQQWx-NtfhjdmE_TJAC1hC ▶️])==




In the first season ([https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyEl4OXPIVcKYhirstzGcfGQ1P8rzETlu ▶️]) of Planet Minecraft, Cyranno W. Kelbrid begins construction on a city in the middle of an Ice Plains Biome. He says that he will keep the name of the world (and by proxy the name of the series) unnamed until he finds a name he likes, which would be suggested by a viewer in the comment section of one of the videos. He progressively explores more of the world and does many things such as rescuing a village from starvation (even though Kelbrid knows that they can't actually starve), mine some of the few ores in the caves beneath the expanding city, and build houses and farms for his town. In &quot;An Inspirational Aftermath&quot; ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZpuz4bHmao&amp;index=5&amp;list=PLyEl4OXPIVcKYhirstzGcfGQ1P8rzETlu ▶️]), Kelbrid updated the world's difficulty to &quot;Hard&quot;. which allows hostile mobs to spawn in his city.
|}
In &quot;The Last Few Days&quot; ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xynuc3wzZE&amp;index=6&amp;list=PLyEl4OXPIVcKYhirstzGcfGQ1P8rzETlu ▶️]), Kelbrid reveals that he had discovered a Meza Biome during one of his expanded explorations out of the city, and in &quot;Silent Night&quot; ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLsnir2wZmE&amp;index=7&amp;list=PLyEl4OXPIVcKYhirstzGcfGQ1P8rzETlu ▶️]), he discovers a second village far from his city. In a silent video, Kelbrid reveals that the Planet Minecraft world had the misfortune of being corrupted in a chunk error, which has caused abnormal world generations outside the city.

A series of mob attacks in the city cause the it to become damaged and eventually, Cyranno's house is burned down in the episode &quot;The Fires of Jamestown&quot; ([https://youtu.be/j72T29TCXWY ▶️]). This event leads to the second part of the first season ([https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyEl4OXPIVcKQQWx-NtfhjdmE_TJAC1hC ▶️]), in which Kelbrid starts to build more houses and begins to expand the city. For the episode &quot;Keep It PG!&quot; ([https://youtu.be/cbeMp4iaT8k ▶️]), as well as a few subsequent videos, Abel Hernandez co-starred alongside Kelbrid as his companion, Lil' Abe. He grants Abel residence within the city (which by then has been given the name Jamestown) before the two set off to explore the Nether dimension in &quot;The Nether Expedition, Parts 2 &amp; 3&quot; ([https://youtu.be/PG2faMKAs2s ▶️]). Kelbrid eventually comes to the conclusion that he strongly hates the Nether dimension, or more specifically, the mobs within.

At this point in the series, Cyranno W. Kelbrid creates an intelligent &quot;false player&quot;, titled the [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/cyrannomat-webi.html Cyrannomat], that is eventually granted citizenship within the city. However, Kelbrid discovers that it's creation is actually becoming sentient. A worried Kelbrid prepares for a confrontation with it's creation by giving it a voice, but is unable to do so since he has been caught by the Cyrannomat while trying to break into his house to investigate. The Cyrannomat uses it's voice against Kelbrid, and begins threatening him, repeatedly chanting Kelbrid's catchphrase &quot;You will be erradicated!&quot;, and starts chasing him before dissapearing in a menacing manner.

Kelbrid is finally able to have a proper conversation with the Cyrannomat, which, reveals that, despite it's programming, it has begun to grow afraid of the potential threat that is Kelbrid to the Cyrannomat, and thus the Cyrannomat began to experiment with weapons and redstone so that it may be able to defend itself in the event that it had to. It also saw itself as a slave to Kelbrid and was offended by this concept. Kelbrid clarified his purpose within the game and apologizes to the clone, giving it full citizenship in Jamestown. Somehow, the Cyrannomat fails to accept the apology from Kelbrid and begins to attack him before purposely crashing the game. In the final scene of the episode, he proclaims that he would return to assassinate it's creator.
|}
It isn't long before Kelbrid realizes the serious threat that the Cyrannomat poses, and therefore he proceeds to destroy the Cyrannomat's house. Despite being killed several times in various different places both in the Overworld and the Nether, the Cyrannomat is somehow still able to gain such strength that he is forced to update himself into a newer form (R. Flores). 

Despite being a Minecraft series, however, it's revealed that filming for Season 1 of the series is actually difficult due to the fact that he's having conflicts with his stepfather, &quot;[https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/affiliated-people-list-webi.html Stepdad Rodolfo]&quot;. For this reason, a small amount of episodes in Season 1 were actually silent.

&quot;The Last Few Days&quot; featured &quot;Stuck In Nostalgia (Besnine Remix)&quot;, making it the first episode in the series to have music. This episode is relatively short, and instead of being a gameplay video, it's a montage of a few previous discoveries made by Kelbrid. It is the first to feature an outro. However, it wouldn't be classified as an official outro since it was made in a such a rush that it looked rather unprofessional.

The world's seed is currently unknown for the moment, The main biome to have been discovered or explored has been the Ice Plains Biome in which the city resides. The world also had the misfortune of being corrupted in a chunk error, which caused abnormal world generations outside the city. The previous time it had happened was in one of Kelbrid's previous worlds, which was [https://nixxons-alliance.weebly.com/wayland-city-webi.html Wayland City].

The chunk error brought a second village into the world as well as a Meza biome which Kelbrid explored in some episodes.

The Player Resistance is a resistance movement against the current Admins of the CraftedMovie server. They are led by former youtuber and admin Salted. Their base of operations is underneath the server and it can be entered by going through a secret portal in each of the CraftedMovie subservers. The resistance's aim is to bring down the current admins led by Peppered, Salted's arch nemesis. Most of the resistance members hang out in the subservers. The resistance usually raid moderator camps and weapons factories.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6759">'''Predator '''is a war-simulation game of survival. In the game, players are pitted against one another in a limited area, and must seek out and kill each other with limited resources. They must do this, however, while trying to survive the environment and defend themselves from players hunting them.
==Basis==
===Object===
The main purpose of the game is to hunt the other players involved in the game. This must be done, however, in a single biome which players are not allowed to leave. Each player starts off with an identical package of &quot;starter items&quot; (see full list below) and must utilise the resources in that biome to not only survive, but use them in their hunt of the other participants.

The player with the most points at the end of the game is the champion (see point system below).
===Length===
There is no set time limit on the game. The game will only end when all players except one are eliminated. The game will be played both during days and nights.

Immediately following the beginning of the game, a three-minute grace period will ensue in which players are forbidden from attacking each other. During this time, players may seek out suitable locations, establish base camps, and/or gather resources.
===Location===
The game is played in a single biome. Though almost any biome will work, ideally it should be a jungle, tundra, or desert biome for the fullest &quot;survival feel&quot;. The biome should be relatively large to ensure plenty of space for the game to take place. Players will begin in extreme corners of the biome, separate from each other.

In the centre of each biome, a small, neutral house will be constructed that holds chests of limited yet useful resources. The first participant to reach the house may reap the rewards. Other than that, the main purpose of the house is to serve as a reference point and/or battle front.
===Players===
At least two participants are required for the game to function; however, the max number of players allowed to play in one game is infinite. Ideally, an average game will have 4-6 players.

Teams are allowed. However, all teams must be pre-decided prior to the game to avoid confusion. Also, all teams must be balanced (i.e., there must be an even number of participants for there to be teams).
===Base Camps===
As part of the game, players are allowed (and encouraged) to construct base camps anywhere in the designated biome. These base camps may be used, as the name suggests, as areas for the player to establish a foothold and perhaps render defense against their opponents. Only resources acquired from the designated biome may be used in constructing the base camp.

There are, however, rules and regulations regarding the base camps. For these limitations, see the rules below.
==Point System==
The player with the most points at the end of the game is victorious. While one gains points for overpowering their opponents, one can also be deducted points.
*Environmental Death (hunger, drowning, burning, falling objects, etc.) = -10
*NPC Mob Death (being killed by monsters) = -50
*Death by Opponent (another participant has killed you) = automatic elimination
*Killing an Opponent (hunting and killing another participant) = +50
*Last Man Standing (being the last participant to not be killed) = +100
The participants are responsible for keeping track of their own scores, except for instances when a third-party referee overviews the game.

==Rules==
The following rules are to be abided at all times whilst the game is in progress. Failure to do so will result in a deduction of points, or, more severely, expulsion from the game.
*Players must arrive to the game with a clear inventory, including no armour. All players will be given an identical &quot;starting items&quot; package which they may utilise (see starting items list below).
*Participants may not leave the designated biome at any time once the game commences. This includes teleporting, warping, and constructing Nether Portals.
*Participants may not place claims anywhere in the biome, including base camps. Additionally, homes may not be set.
*While one can go underground to salvage resources, players may not construct base camps underground; all base camps or other defensive structures must be constructed on or above the earth's surface.
*Looting, raiding, and griefing base camps is allowed.
*Fly mode may ''only ''be enabled to help break falls; it may not be actually used to fly.
*Once a player is eliminated, they may remain in the biome to spectate the game; however, they may not offer aid to any remaining players.
*During the game, players may forge alliances with one another; just be sure they don't stab you in the back!
*If a player comes across any naturally generated structures within the biome (e.g., villages, dungeons, temples, strongholds), they may use the structure to their advantage.
*Players may also use NPC entities to their advantage (e.g., wolves, ocelots, golems).
*Enchantments may be used if the player amasses the necessary ingredients for an enchantment table.
*In the event that the server crashes or restarts, a one minute grace period will ensue upon each participant's return to the server.
*All other rules of the server apply.
==Starting Items==
All players must arrive with a clear inventory and in turn will be supplied with the following items:
*One iron sword
*One bow
*Twelve arrows
*One wooden pick axe
*One wooden axe
*One wooden shovel
*Four torches
*Five steaks
All other items used in the game besides these must come from the biome.
==Records==
Below is a recorded list of all &quot;Predator&quot; games played on Olexcraft:
===Game #1===
*Date: 9 February, 2013
*Biome: Jungle
*Participants: BaronVonShush, Blake_Stewart, Captain_Naughty, Josefurnace
*Review: Blake_Stewart mysteriously drops out from the game after stalking Josefurnace. Josefurnace is lured into a jungle temple by BaronVonShush and is assassinated upon entry. Captain_Naughty then attempts to find and kill BaronVonShush, but the two meet and Captain_Naughty is ultimately killed, therefore making BaronVonShush the champion.


===Game #2===
*Date: unknown
*Biome: Jungle
*Participants: BaronVonShush, sonicfam, Rocket_93, Captain_Naughty
*Review: Captain_Naughty drops out early. BaronVonShush begins mining for resources, setting up a camp and disguising it as a tree. Sonicfam gets too close to the camp and shot with arrows. A duel between sonicfam and BaronVonShush begins, with sonic being killed. Sonic's head is mounted on a pole and BaronVonShush resumes gathering materials for the base. Rocket_93 sneaks up on BaronVonShush, gloats, and attacks Baron as he turns around. BaronVonShush flees to a pond and attempts to attack Rocket_93, but is ultimately killed.

The Realm of Jolvo (R.o.J.) was founded by Joseph Jolvon, in Minecraft version beta 1.6.1. The city is an island that was first started in the middle of no where. Now the city has a population count of 500,000 people as of 2014 and is one of the most robust metropolis in Craftia. The metropolis population is increasing by at least 100,000 each year.

==Climate==
The [[Realm of Jolvo]] has an average of 10 F in the winter, while in the summer it can jumped into the 90s but is commonly in the cool 70s. The metropolis has recently been hit by mysteriously outbreaks of snow storms. Recently in the summer the city has to withstand at least 2 hurricanes each year. Luckily, the city has not reported any tornadoes since Beta 1.8.

===Environment===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8126">Rocket_93 is a veteran player of Minecraft, who has accumlated possibly 1,000+ hours into the game.

[[File:Law.jpg|thumb|The flag flown by the Marauder Noir crew.]]His remarkable skills in combat, building, and his naval capabilities. His notoriety has gained him a decent amount of fame among the Minecraft community as being a great player, but also a threat in most situations.

Rocket is the current King of the Pirates, with a small crew. He sailed many ships in his life. Rocket's large bounty has resulted in constant bombardment by the marines.

Rocket eventually formed one of the most infamous crews known to the world. The Marauder Noir pirates. Ruthless, but also k nowing what is right, they laid claim to all opposing forces. The crew consisted of Rocket himself, Cannonwalker, David Horrible, SlimeEnder, Baron von Shush, Jeremiah Garland, and &quot;Yellow Eagle&quot; Squirto. All of which with bounties beyond billions.

==&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:20px;&quot;&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;rigin==

&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14px;&quot;&gt;As a child, Rocket always dreamt of far-away places. He often drew maps of his hometown, and often made model ships. His thirst for knowledge always outmatched other important things in life. Rocket also pursued swordsmanship, eventually becoming a master of the Three&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14px;&quot;&gt; Sword Style. The Three Sword Style is where a user holds two blades in each hand, and one in their mouth by the hilt.                                                      &lt;/span&gt;


Rocket tended to be the pest of his village, always causing trouble. He often would run through town, yelling about vicious pirates on the shore, coming to invade. The villagers would become terrified, and arm themselves, only to find Rocket bust a gut in laughter, saying it was just a lie. Other times, he would sneak into peoples' homes, and switch around their books, with another person's collection. Rocket eventually was given a bounty of a small $5, mostly for his annoyance to the town. Nobody bothered for this though, as they knew that Rocket wouldn't

learn.

After a few years, Rocket had finally matured, and had only one goal in his adolescence: to set sail on the ocean his home town sat on top of,the Old Blue. Rocket eventually contacted an old friend of his, SirFancyPenguin. They had known each other since Rocket was a trouble-making child. Penguin had decided to go into the business of building vessels. Rocket paid Penguin $50,000 he had saved since he was about ten years old, for a decent ship. Penguin gave the ship to Rocket, and Rocket fell in love.

She was made of a dark wood, with plain white sails. with a cannon on each side, and two masts. Rocket thanked Penguin multiple times, with great praise. Rocket nearly burst into tears, as his dream was about to be realized. He decided to the name the ship &quot;[[The Crimson Rose]].&quot; He took down the white sails, and had the local artist paint the entire sails red, and a black rose on both. 

After carrying back the folded sails to his ship, the entire town was there, making a clear line to the ship, allowing Rocket to board. Rocket tried to be strong, and not to cry as he walked, but he dropped to the ground and cried. He exclaimed how ashamed he was for all the pain and trouble and caused them. They all sobbed, to see the young child that they all scorned, grown into a young man, leave. Rocket decided he would plant a stake in the sand, with a white flag tied to it with &quot;Hope&quot; painted on it. He promised to come back one day to remove it once he became the king of the pirates. With that, he set sail, he would not see his village for the majority of his life.
==The Province of Vix==
Rocket had finally reached land after about seven weeks. Rocket was exhausted, and laid anchor. He was soon greeted by a man named Broken Stars. Broken Stars was a member of the government in this land. He told Rocket that the place he landed on was named &quot;Vix.&quot; Rocket bought supplies, and bought himself a black badana, which he wears now today.

Rocket quickly learned the government was in dire need of purifying. The corrupt group would storm the streets, demanding absurd and proposterous priced taxes. If the person didn't pay the full tax, their home would be torched, and their children would be enslaved. Rocket watched the government's vicious raid on the town, in disgust of their acts. He decided he would organize a revolution and free the people of Vix.

After a few months, Rocket had organized a group of about 50 people, each with a hate for the Vixian government. One day, though, a small ship had landed on shore. Rocket quickly ran to it and discovered it was a man named Cannonwalker. Rocket proceeded with caution when coming to greet the stranger. Rocket told him about the corruption of the island, and Cannonwalker joined the rebellion instantly.

Cannonwalker arrived at the base, surprised at how many people there were. He quickly noted that no matter how many people they had, their bare hands weren't going to be enough.Cannonwalker then volunteered to rob a few government lackeys of their wallets through pickpocketing to gain funds for them. He had quickly gained $6,000 within time, which he used to purchase many swords, bows, and helmets. He also bought three cutlasses for Rocket.

The siege on the government building was a bloody massacre. The resistance was lined up outside, chanting &quot;Corruption! Corruption! Corruption!&quot; Broken Stars from earlier, had came outside, armed. He yelled how he was tired of working for evil, and he joined with the chant. 

The building was soon stormed, and the people were massacred. Rocket did not give up, and took out the remaining of the government with difficulty. He left the building in a pile of rubble, cheering with the remaining resistance, Cannonwalker, and Broken Stars.

Rocket decided it was time for him to leave, and let the people decide what government they thirst for.

Broken Stars told Rocket of his religious journey he planned to make. Rocket wished the both luck, and set off. Rocket told him farewell, and wished him luck.

Cannonwalker said he had no purpose in his life right now, and didn't know what to do. Rocket then told him how he was going to become the king of the pirates, and invited Cannonwalker to his crew. Cannonwalker quickly accepted, and became their marksman. Cannonwalker had explained how he was gifted at a pistol, and could fire a cannon and hit a target from a mile away. 

The duo sailed off into the sun, wondering where they will end up next.
==Their Minds on the Water==
It was about 2 days after the events of Vix. Rocket and Cannonwalker were bored as they could be aboard the Rose. Rocket was leaning with his arms on the guardrail, staring off to the horizon, occasionally fiddling with one of his katanas. Cannonwalker was sitting by the portside cannon, polishing it as he thought of the future.

&quot;We have to do something. Do you even know where we're going?&quot; Cannonwalker said in frustration.

&quot;It's beyond me. I just set sail, and we're just going to land somewhere. Simple as that.&quot; Rocket said back. He could care less at the moment to what happened.

&quot;Well, we have to do something!&quot; Cannonwalker replied.

&quot;Grab the wheel, take us somewhere.&quot; Rocket said, as he began polishing his blades.

Cannonwalker just sat down in boredom again, dozing off to sleep. Rocket went into below the deck to get some food. Rocket then went back up, and studied the map of the Old Blue. Rocket then noticed something that almost made him spit out a mouthful of bread.

&quot;CANNONWALKER! GET UP HERE!&quot; Rocket yelled, startling Cannonwalker.

&quot;What do you want?&quot; Slurred Cannonwalker, as he went up to the bow.

&quot;Look, we're about here,&quot; Rocket pointed to a location on the map. &quot;If we sail East, there's a place to rest. We're a little low on food. I say we could get there by tomorrow night if nothing delays us.&quot; Rocket pointed to a medium-sized island.

Rocket then ran to the wheel, and steered to the island. He couldn't wait to see what lay ahead of him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1086">'''Savica '''was a town situated on the [[GabeWorld]] server. It was led by Rocket_93 (since he had ownership of the claims).
==History==
Savica started around February 2014 as a makeshift base by BaronVonShush. Rocket_93 came along and asked Baron if he could help build upon it; Baron agreed to the idea. Rocket built the storage area, smelting room, and made the grass and wood pavement. Later on, Squirto19 joined in on the town. Next came Captain_Naughty, then Dirty_Mallace and finally Cannonwalker.

In hopes of making operations go by in a more smooth manner, a parliament room was established. Here bills would be submitted to a chest, later read by the citizens and put to a vote. At some point towards the end of GabeWorld's lifetime, AwesomeA321 and Cannonwalker built a base for [[Team Piston]] below Savica's enchanting room.

He also knows the weaknesses of every hostile mob in the game.&lt;/u&gt; A few months later he can be watched in Polish YouTube films made by Kosa-Robak Studio.

[[File:2012-05-25_19.34.32.png|center|400px]]
===The Seed===
&quot;'''Stpattiesday'''&quot;

Sharple discovered a mountain in the north part of the seed, he then started to construct his whole body into a statue.

[[File:2012-06-13_17.59.34.png|thumb|312px|Construction. ]]


==Base of Operations==
This was Sharple's first base of operations in his hunt for wilderness game. This is also where he encounters his first appearance of the legendary [[Herobrine]] and the murderer of his parents. Sharple's first order of business was deciding where to start constructing his base. He decided to search in the northern part of the world, where he found just the right mountain to do it. He left his mark by leaving a statue of himself. Legend has it, that his statue is there today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4192">[[File:SteveSkin.png|thumb|100px|Steve, the default skin.]]A '''Skin''' refers to the texture that is placed onto a player model or a mob.

The skin is divided into areas that act as the surface area of the character (For example, there's the front head area, left leg area, etc.). A skin will only allow solid color; transparency is not allowed on the skin file except in the second head area, which is transparent by default. The second head layer can be used to give the character glasses, hats, or other accessories (even a bigger head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size=1&gt;Taken from the [http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Skin Minecraft wiki].&lt;/font&gt;

Spark_Flenger is a  dwarf warrior from Minenstock. He is a well and skilled adventurer and one of the main protagonists in ''The Chronicles of Minecraftia.''

==History==

Spark_Flenger was born in the dwarven city of Minenstock. He has lived there his entire life. He was well known for being a very tough dwarf and decided to venture through Minecraftia. He does indeed return to his home at times. He one day ventured to northern Minecraftia where he met Master_Emma. They went on adventures throughout all of Minecraftia. They eventually met some other people (who's names I will come up with later) and they all ventured through Minecraftia. Eventually, they had to go on a journey to defeat Herobrine and save the world.

==Personality==

Spark is kind, but often hides it in order to act tough. Like all dwarves, he loves to mine.
==Appearence==
he has an orange beard, usual dwarven clothing, black eyes, and a blue helmet, which he claims is made of diamonds.[[Category:Players]][[Category:Redstoners]][[Category:Stories]]</text>

So I have seen all these people on Minecraft and I would like to give a thanks to the for helping me build, fight, and farm my way through Minecraft.

-Novarl

-Djkaye

-Selene011

-Chebear

-EthanRmartin

Thank you all for helping me!!!

So yes, I have been raided in these servers MULTIPLE times!!It's the #1 thing that I hate most.

My favorite thing to do in servers is to make friends and build towns together and let people live in them.I have done that before on FuriousPvP, and im sure you already know what happened afterward.

I plan on having a hobby of making videos of Minecraft and becoming a recognized Minecraft player.

I hope that being on this wiki will give me a head start on becoming a recognized Minecraft player.

[[File:Squirto19.png]]
&lt;/center&gt;

Squirto19, man of mystery. Very few know of his existence, even fewer know that much about him. Those who gain his respect, gain his friendship and trust. He is quick to hold grudges, and never forgets someone who has wronged him. Those who have wronged him, never forget to never cross him again.


&lt;font size= 5 &gt;The Templars&lt;/font&gt;


Squirto joined the Templars late on in its creation, but has tried to make up for that by helping as much as he can. Helping rebuild most of the base after an inside job from a traitorous member.


&lt;font size = 5&gt;Short History&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size = 4px color = red&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;WARNING:&quot; SPOILERS AHEAD FOR THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Squirto grew up in a bad home, his mother died when he was very young, and his father drank milk, and did seeds because of her death. As soon as Squirto was old enough, he ran away from his home, and started his own life. Though he found many towns, none appealed to him, so he became a hermit. He would visit the towns every so often to trade items, and sell things, but just as quickly he would leave. He began a few friendships in a town called Olex, many of which he still has today. In Olex he even helped a few friends build communities. After a fire which burned all of Olex, Squirto traveled to many distant lands, finding more friends, and having many adventures. Later in his life, Squirto was recruited by the [[Templars (Faction)|Templars]], and is still a part of it to this day.


&lt;font size = 5&gt;Autobiography&lt;/font&gt;


Squirto was born on September 24th, to Joan and Paul 19. Into their small but loving home. During his infant years Squirto watched his father work on all of his projects. None of them worked that well, but they always turned out to be great toys for him. When Squirto was only 5 his mother died, and his father slipped into drinking Milk and doing seeds. Squirto hid in his room for most of his childhood, escaping every so often to find food for himself. After living with his father for 13 years, barely surviving, Squirto finally left. Setting out with only the clothes on his back, to begin his new life. Leaving the past behind him. After a few months of wandering, he came upon the town of Olex. After a while he realized he liked the people in this community. Though he did like them, he didn't stay in the town, he tended to live on the outskirts of it, only coming into town when he needed to.


&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color = gray&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;To be continued&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;font color=gray&gt;Overview of Squirtville's Townhall and Shops.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


After years of being a hermit, [[Squirto19|Squirto]] finally decided to settle down and start his own town. Somewhere he could retreat too after too many minutes spent with others. Even though it isn't finished yet, he does enjoy the town very much.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=gray&gt;History of Squirtville&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Feeling as if he should finally settle down, Squirto searched for a town that he could call home. After searching, he decided to make his own town. Starting from nothing but scratch, and building his perfect town. Through many trials, and many mobs, he began to see his progress. Slowly rising up, and never stopping.

[[File:2012-04-07 00.14.59.png|thumb|The New Order]]
There once was a land called Lostshard. It was considered by most to be a very harsh place to live in with all of the murderers and cheats running around. At the second age of the server came two different towns Baghdad and Booty Bay. Baghdad was a place guarded by the best so that people could walk around and trade their items at the bank and not give any worry to what might be behind them. Booty Bay was the opposite, here you would find the worst of the cheats murderers. Now at the dawn of the second age came to wandering explorers Funnyguy, and Magicman. These young fellows were looking for a new place to set up a new home and start over, hopefully making new friends along the way. But that was not all they would be making on this very long journey, enemies were scattered about.

Chapter 1 Tsarce

Magic and Funny had been in the town of Baghdad for two days now and Magic was ready to explore, that morninghe had gone through town and bought a new set of chainmail from the vendors and a stone sword. His ming was racing with all the different places he and Funny could build their new house. &quot;Maybe it would have a lot of farms so they would never grow hungry.&quot; He said to himself, he'd have to bring the idea up to Funny later but first he had to search for a place, he told his friend he was heading out and stepped out of the gate, a place where there were no guards to save you if you needed help.

He wasn't four blocks out of the gate when he noticed a man in full diamond armour perched on top of the mountain. Looking down on the city and eventually casting a glance at him.

&quot;Hello there traveller!&quot; shouted Magic in attempt to talk to the man &quot;What might be your name?&quot;

The man stood up, looking rather taller than other natives to Lostshard. &quot;My name is Tsarce, friend.&quot; his eyes were the color of night and Magic had a hard time reading his face. Not once did it occur to him that he could mean harm, he was new to the land so why would anyone to harm him anyways?

&quot;Mind if I talk to you about land for a moment Mr. Tsarce?&quot; Magic began climbing the mountain to sit on top with the armored man. &quot;I was thinking of going that way, what are your thoughts on that? Any clear land?&quot;.

Tsarce turned his head to the direction Magic had pointed and shook his head, &quot;You don't want to settle in those lands, that is where the Council of the Three Hammers resides, terrible murderers, you'd never make it.&quot; Magic's face fell into a frown and Tsarce looked back at him &quot;Of course there are murderers every where though, in fact, you are talking to one now.&quot; Tsarce drew his detailed wand and pointed it at Magic &quot;You should probably run kid, I will give you a slight chance.&quot; He muttered a couple of inaudible words and the ground in front of Magic burst into a field of fire threatening to burn his legs. Without thinking further he began to run back to the city, once inside he could call guards to help, he just had to get there.

Tsarce was not even running to catch up with him though, everytime Magic looked back he would disappear and reappear back closer to him, Magic came up to the gate and jumped through it yelling for the guards but he never hit the ground. In fact he doesn't even remember what happened, just tales from people who saw it. He woke up the next morning with Funnyguy holding a bowl of mushroom soup over him, 

&quot;It's pretty amazing thay you survived that guy they say Magic, he's one of the worst muderers in the land.&quot; Funny said handing the bowl to Magic who had set up, ready to get out of bed. &quot;Right when you jumped through that gate he engulfed you in a ball of ice, it was quite extraordinary, except the part where you could of died of course...&quot; 

Magic closed his eyes and retraced the events that had apparently led up to him getting stuck in a ball of ice. He needed to know how to fight back, and he was going to find someone to teach him.

Chapter 2 Macedonia

Funny peered through the gate, &quot;Nobody in sight.&quot; He whispered back at Magic, they were using the night to their advantage attempting to find a place to put their home. Magic nodded back to Funny who then left the safety of Baghdad. They planned on heading near the Council of Three Hammers building but hopefully nobody would notice them. Funny looked over a small mountain and realized there was a forest, pretty niced sized one to. Magic sat beside him on the slope and looked at it.

&quot;We could set up a nice little house right there.&quot; he said getting prepared to walk down to it. Funny nodded and follow him down to the forest. They had to work fast before day so they cleared out a small patch of trees and set up a cobble building, it was a pretty nice little house for two beginners.

&quot;Now to put a protective spell on it.&quot; said Magic pulling out a book filled with all different sorts of spells. He stood in the center and chanted the spell, a circle then glowed around the house, the spell had worked and now it needed a name. They both agreed on naming it Macedonia. They finally had a new house and they were ready to start making it even better, but their joy soon died out and turned into worry, for Tsarce was a master at getting inside plots.

Chapter 3 Tofflenheim and the Three Hammers 

Magic laid his pickaxe down after a long day and sat down in his mine that was connected to his house through an iron door. Funny was inside practicing some magic and Magic thought he might join him later, but first he needed to eat. He sat down on a pile of dirt and pulled out some bread their farm upstairs had produced. 

As he began munching he could of sworn he heard something, but shook his head. It was most likely a loose rock or a Funny pratcicing spells. But then he heard the sound again, this time much closer. The sound was like feet landing on the ground, but no foot steps were present. Then before he could stand up to inspect it Tsarce appeared in front of him making Magic drop his bread and fall on the ground.

&quot;Hello my little friend.&quot; Said Tsarce stuffing his wand back in his belt. &quot;No guards to run to here.&quot; Magic tried to stand up but received a kick in the stomach forcing him back down. Tsarce then began to beat him, over and over again, Magic felt as if death would have been welcome here but just as that thought came a field of cobwebs surrounded Tsarce at his making it hard for him to move the slightest bit. 

&quot;Hurry run!&quot; said Funny who had opened the door to the house.&quot; Magic stood up and got inside as fast as he could. Inside Funny threw him a wand. &quot;Lets get to Baghdad.&quot; Magic nodded and ran through the front door using his newly learned teleport spell to get ahead. Funny followed close by but Tsarce was to quick.Thinking fast Magic looked at the Three Hammer building, they always had traps open for those brave enough to even get close to them. Magic would rather die at the hands of the Council than this Tsarce scum.

&quot;Funny the traps!&quot; he shouted teleporting to the front door of the intimidating building. beside it was a portal that would lure the curious and trap them in a cobble wall. He racked up his courage and jumped through the portal and soon Funny followed him in the room, bleeding from a large gash in his arm.

&quot;He got me Magic, that Tsarce piece of trash murderer got my arm pretty good.&quot; Magic looked at the cut, it was deep. He didn't know any spells for health and even if he did he didn't have the reagents, neither did he have wool to do a proper bandage. He tore a strip of his shirt off and tied the bandange. 

&quot;We have to wait here, there is no way getting out, they have lapiz here to stop spells.&quot;

A couple of minutes passed and a man walked through a door on the other side of the cage Magic and Funny were stuck in. He looked surprised to see us there waiting for him, most just committed suicide to escape their maybe even worse fate.

&quot;Please sir! My friend is hurt, we will do anything just free us please sir!&quot; The man looked at Funny's wound and opened the door, he had nothing to worry about, he was a hammer and could fight off anyone that came to him. He looked the two up and down, he knew they were knew just by the way they talked, begging to a murderer never worked, almost never that is. Something about the way they asked for help made the man want to help them. 

&quot;Bring him here.&quot; he said pulling out his wand. The wound had now bled through Magic's shirt and was covering the floor. &quot;Magikus healius&quot; he muttered and the wound closed up leaving a slight scar. 

&quot;Tha- Thank you sir!&quot; said Funny rubbing the scar

&quot;Call me Tofflenheim or Toffles, you said you would help me, I need miners, follow me.&quot; He said turning back and walking through a portal. Funny and Magic looked at each other and followed. Even if it was a trap, at least they were away from Tsarce.

Chapter 4 Learning to Fight Back

Funny and Magic had been mining for Tsarce for about a year now. They were inducted into the clan and were now very rich along with Toffles. Everyday they would wake up and walk through their portals leading to mining camps so they could continue their shafts and quarries. This was all very good work for them but Magic wanted more he wished to fight like Tofflenheim and one day kill Tsarce and anyone else who dared to fight him. He had addressed the idea to Funny but he was set with mining, he liked the idea but didn't feel it was the life for him.

== History ==
Sword14wk was born in the skull server, named because the server symbol was a skeleton skull. Sword's father was Axe14wk, a member of the admins and wanted to introduce reforms to make the iron server a better place. Sword was close to his father and his mother. When Sword was young, Sword's mother and Axe were killed in a home invasion . Sword was then raised in a skull orphanage and was known to speak only sometimes and was anti-social.

== The skull army ==
Like most at the orphanage, Sword was conscripted into the skull army, and was considered the most loyal soldier. Sword participated in many battles, such as the desert battle and the takeovers of other factions. Sword was skilled in battle and he never left a soldier behind. Though over time, Sword found himself beginning to doubt the skull server, especially the head Admin Mytros.[[Category:Players]]</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2717">This is really super triple real. i have a true story that happened to me and im not lying please believe me.

I was walking around my world i recently spawned in the newest version of minecraft i was chopping down some trees and made a sword and decided to kill some animals for beds armor and food. i was surprised when i saw this tree with no leaves it was burning but there was lava beside it, then beside the tree i noticed a sign with a steve head beside it containing these word(s): I'm watching you.. and i was completely shocked by the sight of it because it was single player world and i ran off into a snow biome. i found a skeleton and killed it and was able to tame a wolf, i was walking with my dog when he ran off and i saw a figure with the default skin but blank eyes and i freaked out and i ran so fast but he had speed potion so i quit the game. i was able to get a screen shot of him and when i looked for it i saw something and i clicked on it and it said: &quot;You can defeat me but only one way give me a diamond and i'll leave&quot; i was  relieved for there was a way to defeat this person known as &quot;Herobrine&quot; I went mining and i found all sorts of ore but when i found one diamond i was sad. this was the FIRST TIME i ever got diamonds and i didn't wanna give it away but i had to. i found 3 diamonds so i was glad he asked for one so i found him standing on the tree i was mining next to. he had a sign and he placed it down and simpy wrote: &quot;Diamond?&quot; and i gave him a diamond keeping two diamonds in my inventory A.K.A backpack and he said &quot;You son of a gun i know you have more&quot; so i gave him the last two sighing deeply and he said &quot;A deal's a deal.&quot; and it said &quot;Herobrine left the game&quot; and i jumped because my brother was standing next to me wided eyed and said with a sigh: &quot;You should of never done that...he now stays in your worlds forever..&quot; i looked at him with a freaky look &quot;Well guess what? he said he haunted you too&quot; he took a deep breath and walked away so i yelled &quot;BETTER TELL ME THE TRUTH YOU'LL REGRET IT!&quot; and i took a deep breath and continued to mine in my world. i finally found some more diamond and dug into a stronghold and i got prepared and i died about 7 times but i won at least. i walked out of the space with the dragon egg and put the egg in a giant iron bar cage and he was born at least about 20 minecraft days (i played 10 days on the 5th and 10 on the 6th) and i rode him around and destroyed a village and raided it fully. i quit the game and before i could leave the page the title said &quot;HeroCraft&quot; and i punched my computer screen not hard and it got a tiny crack in it though. i fixed it and went on and deleted minecraft and i never played since then.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1962">'''Team Piston '''was a player syndicate that based their operations out of [[GabeWorld]]. Their collective goal was to dominate the economy of GabeWorld (although GabeWorld's economic properties explicitly made this impossible).
==History==
Team Piston was created by Cannonwalker and AwesomeA321 as their version of the villainous teams from Pokemon games (Team Rocket, Team Magma, Team Aqua, etc). Their goal was simple; become an economic superpower in GabeWorld. They hoped to achieve this by growing and selling nether warts, which the server bought for copious amount of money. Baron and Cannonwalker had already made lots of money off of this trade and hoped to use it for something.&lt;gallery type=&quot;slideshow&quot;&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Team Piston's original headquarters, which was later referred to as the &quot;sea headquarters,&quot; was [[The Black Warrior]]; Cannonwalker's own home. However, AwesomeA would later begin construction of a land headquarters underneath the enchanting room of Savica (a village the group all were members of). The floors were made out of wood and the walls out of iron blocks, with one giant &quot;P&quot; made out of red wool on one of the walls. A ladder in the corner extended upwards to a room filled with brewing stands and it extended downwards to what would have been the sleeping quarters for the group. However, GabeWorld shut down before the sleeping quarters could be built.

'''''Short Summary:'''''

''TechARTS is an odd fellow with his character and clumsyness, his love for milk is desirable and his pet hate for the texture and sound of gravel is a huge thing, will sometimes say something witty or just completely flawed and pointless making that awkward moment funny in a not so funny way.''



'''''Character Background:'''''

&lt;span style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;

''&lt;span id=&quot;cke_bm_105S&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;TechARTS (Tech for short) was a part of a proud race of Drows that had congregated to the stars, Specifically Mars.''

''He was the first Drow child to be born on mars as a result of the big move, and as he grew up he didn't play well with other children, he was always a loner in his own way, instead of toys he would play with Technical Devices and learnt how to work alongside them, now adopting the nickname Tech because of his love for technology.''

''At the age of 19, he was starting to become very clumsy, always tripping over things and such, one day he was messing with the planets core systems that Controlled the planets ecosystem hoping to fix it and make life better outside on the surface of the planet for his fellow Drow colony, as he was getting up from a crouching position he bumped his head onto a lever flicking it on that had a label above it stating &quot;Planet Self-Destruct Module - Pull in case of  emergency&quot;.''

&lt;span style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;

''&lt;span id=&quot;cke_bm_106S&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Red lights started to flash as a loud emergency klaxon was going off alerting the whole colony to the oncoming destruction, he pulls the lever back down turning off the alert as he looks around feeling awkward and starts to run for the emergency exit where the escape pod room is, he then climbs into a pod and activates the emergency release quickly putting on the pods space suit which was provided, he clips in his seatbelt and holds steady as he feels the firing mechanism shooting the capsule towards earth.''

''A year and a half later, his pod crashes into a ravine into a cave, he then emerges from the capsule unable to see around as it is so dark, he climbs to the very top as he peers over at the landscape feeling bewildered at the sight before him, it was all green and there was weird wooden structures with organic greenery on top of them, he then smiles and thinks to himself &quot;this is where my adventure begins&quot;.''

''He goes to step forward as he feels his foot keep going down as he trips and stumbles back into the ravine...... hope you enjoyed the storie guys, peace!!''

Templar Mercenaries was created by AlReyesSpark under the order of [[Jeremiah Garland|Captain_Naughty]] as an indirect way of recruiting to the main Templars faction. The plan is to have people wanting to join the Templars first join the Templar Mercenaries, and the ones who are deemed to be the most trustworthy and skilled are promoted to the main faction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18176">==&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:20px;&quot;&gt;Sixteen Men, No Mercy, One Goal&lt;/span&gt;==
'''The Templars''' are a faction based in Elitecraft (''ec-mc.co.uk''). Several experienced minecraftian fighters have joined in the group to aid in the blood-thirsty hunt for domination. While some members are new to the faction world of minecraft, many members have been through several, including the original POTCOplayers server where most started. 

The ultimate goal of the faction is complete domination above the others. There is no mercy given to those who disrespect or underestimate us. 

This is our story. And our facts. We are Templars.
==History and Formation==
===The Beginning (2012)===
On a bright, early spring day in March, Andrew Mallace walked out of his small yet cozy 2-story Moroccan apartment. He stopped by the shopping center to trade some wood for cooked fish from Peter, the leader. It was only then that he, out of the corner of his eye, spotted a light in the distance. He knew far to well that in this dangerous world, an unknown light is never a good sign. Immediately warning the rest of the faction, the men rushed to the giant wooden boat in the center of town that was now aflame.  Mallace hurried back into the shop to warn Peter and grab some armor but it was too late. Standing where Peter stood was the infamous and vicious Daves Davy, sword in hand. Peter's items were spread across the room. Mallace ran for the hills as Leonasta and Robert, other famed fighters, swarmed in and surrounded by the Moroccans with lava buckets in hand. Mallace watched from the hill as fire slowly consumed Morocco and TNT ripped through the city's walls... and later his home. It was this incident that first fueled the revenge factor out of Moroccans. Though only 2 exist today, Peter and Mallace, their blood thirst from that first incident remains untouched. They hope to continue to spread their pain to other factions.

After the battle of Morocco had ended, the men involved split apart. Peter became a Nomad, hopping from city to city. Robert stayed in touch with Davy as they continue to raid smaller, less powerful factions. Mallace quickly ran to Waffleland, a giant city in which he quickly overthrew the mayor and became the Ovelord of. 

The men met briefly on a distant world named Olexcraft, where they would meet BaronVonShush and Goldtimbers, the first a mysterious and powerful lord who shared their blood-thirsty needs, the second a brilliant fighter formerly from Britain. Later, AlReyesSpark would also be discovered

===The Reuniting (2014)===
Thousands of miles away, [[Cannonwalker|Richard Cannonwalker]], much more commonly known as just &quot;Cannonwalker,&quot; was sailing on the Gabe Ocean on his ship, the [[The Black Warrior|Black Warrior]]. On board was BaronVonShush, [[AwesomeA321]] and [[Jeremiah Garland]], the last of which was an old friend of Mallace. The 4 would soon bond together closer on the Island, a distant island in the vast Minedlands. It was there that they reuinted with Mallace, now a rich-overlord but still bloodthisrty for revenge of his Moroccan home. It was there also that Peter would reuinte with Mallace and Garland for the first time since Morocco. 

After Cannonwalker split from the island with Garland, the location of the remaining &quot;originals,&quot; Robert, DAVES and Baron were discovered by Peter. He learned of the existence of a secret society in which the few had been forming along with Goldtimbers. He quickly left the Island and joined them at a newly formed base that the few had been constructing. It was discovered that DAVES and Robert had grown even more powerful that before and had learned a few more tricks when it came to destroying factions. On the way to join them, Peter ran into Jeremiah Garland, whom he told to the existence of the secret society. Knowing the need for men would become eminent, Garland quickly informed Mallace and later Cannonwalker of the existence and location of the base. Each began their travels to the base. 



On June 8, 2014, Viceroy Robert, with agreement from the members, named the newly formed group &quot;Templars.&quot; From there on out, the surge for conquest and revenge (for some) began. 
===The Exit &amp; Return of ViceroyRobert===
During the afternoon of June 20, a dispute between BaronVonShush and ViceroyRobert erupted. Robert had consistently told Baron and the other members of the faction that he didn't want what they called a &quot;Roman bath&quot; situated in a certain area of the tower because of the construction of a mob grinder. Baron, backed by Captain_Naughty and Cannonwalker, insisted that it wasn't a huge issue and that accommodations could be met to have both. Robert, infuriated by this suggestion, began tearing down the bath. He then left the faction, taking all of its diamonds and iron.

While the Templars initially decided they wanted to launch a manhunt against Robert, this quickly ended. Robert gave the diamonds and iron to AlReyesSpark, who then returned the items to the chest and notified the group about it. Robert then went on to say that he couldn't be in the Templars because he takes factions more seriously than they do.

On the evening of June 21 Robert returned to the faction. However, Robert had two conditions: the bath be moved to the top floor and that, since they're such a hassle to remove, baths be built in every enemy base during raids.
===Creation of a Sister Faction===
On June 23, 2014, under the commission of Templars Chairman Captain_Naughty, a sister faction was created for the Templars. This sister faction was named [[Templar Mercenaries (Faction)|Templar Mercenaries]], but is often referred to as TemplarMercs. The sister faction is led by AlReyesSpark, and was made as a way of indirectly recruiting people to the Templars. The idea is for Templar hopefuls to join the TemplarMercs and, if approved by Al, promoted to the main faction.

==Members==
===Current===
'''BaronVonShush''': A quiet but powerful fighter, he is extremely loyal to his fellow templars. He has several times defended the base, and his entrepreneurial and quick-thinking mindset has saved the Templars many times.

'''Dirty_Mallace''': Fueled by revenge, Mallace is known to be a vicious sword-fighter. He is the Nuclear-Weapons facilitor and has a talent for crafting TNT. Passionate for his faction-mates, he can usually be found roaming the base.

'''Captain_Naughty''': The current Templars Grandmaster. Also a loyal faction member, he has a farmland skill greater than any other. His ability to feed the faction constantly has saved many from starvation. Though, give him a bow and he's a deadly sharpshooter.

'''The_Goldtimbers''': Skilled in negotiations, he has an experienced tongue that may one day save us all. He can easily mine for cobble and chop wood for hours, making him an essential asset for faction resources.

'''AlReyesSpark''': A promising fighter, he also has talent for gathering resources. Though he may appear ordinary, his lackluster appearnce allows him to stealthily sneak behind enemy lines and become perhaps the greatest source of enemy intelligence for the faction. He is currently running the Templars sister faction, Templar Mercenaries, as a way of indirectly recruiting new members to the main faction.

'''AwesomeA321''': An experienced minecrafter, he knows all-to-well about the revenge factor. Skilled in combat, he is a leader on the battlefield and a humble healer at home. His comedic sense can be soothing in times of rehabiliation. 

'''Cannonwalker''': A newly experienced minecraftian, he is quickly learning the ropes of the blood-thirsty game of factions. Calmed, skilled and organized, he has a talent for quick-thinking and defense. He participated in the second Tower Defense and the highly successful raid of the Looters faction.

'''August_Petrova''': An alter-ego of Mallace, August has an unbelievable amount of TNT on him. He also has the rare ability to fly, use /heal and use /near, which makes him the only and greatest long-range scout and &quot;eyes-in-the-sky&quot; for the faction. 

'''Ned_Edgewalker''': A new but aspiring faction member, he too is still learning the ropes, but swiftly. Armed with slight prior knowledge, Edgewalker is one of the most determined and useful assets to the faction. Always willing to go the extra mile, such as gathering resources when nobody else will, look to him to one day find the cure to cancer. Canadian cancer.

'''Squirto19''': ''TBA''

'''MokikiMorgan''': ''TBA''
===Former===
'''DAVESDAVY''': An infamed raider, revenge is his middle name. Nobody crosses Daves without also receiving a TNT blast in their face. Definitely the most gifted cannon creator, but his skills with a sword and bow are not to be underestimated. He left the Templars when the faction became &quot;too big for his liking.&quot; Bombed the Templars HQ and stole Templar goods alongside ViceroyRobert.

'''ViceroyRobert''': Former Templars Grandmaster, extremely gifted in base defense with water and obsidian; also good with a TNT cannon. Revealed himself to be a double agent and left the Templars, bombing the HQ with DAVESDAVY and stealing from the group in the process.

'''Funnyguy651''': Along with Daves, he was arguably the greatest PVP'er in the faction. He shares the Moroccan thirst for revenge with Mallace. A skilled farmhand and great architect. He betrayed the faction on June 30 by letting ViceroyRobert into the base to set off TNT.

==Battles/Defense==
===The First Tower Defense of June 11th===
Late on June 11, Entendre began their first attack on the Templars Tower. Only Baron and Mallace were on. Outmanned and out-gunned, facing overpowered enchanting armor and a barrage of arrows, Baron and Mallace and later, Petrova (with his flying ability) attempted to stop the TNT cannons from firing. Unfortunately, after dying so many times the two retreated into the base. Thankfully, the TNT cannon only ripped through the outer defense wall, just missing the main base by a few blocks too high. Unfortunately, this wasn't the ''end'' of the battle with Entendre. A day later, they would attack again, but this time we would have much more men and much more determination on our side.

===The Second Tower Defense of June 12th===
On June 12, an Elitecraft faction known only as &quot;Entendre&quot; built a TNT cannon outside of the Templars Tower. Cannonwalker was told that Entendre had done something like this before, but the damage wasn't too bad. Legenzeryfuries, a member of Entendre, led the charge. At first the Templars didn't think Entendre's attack was anything that couldn't be fixed, but their minds were quickly changed.

Entendre began bombarding the Templars Tower with their TNT cannons, and this time they were actually able to infiltrate the tower. ViceroyRobert began gathering up the supplies in the base, saying that Entendre had set homepoints inside of the base and that there was no way to fix their problem. However, Captain_Naughty was determined to stay in the base; Cannonwalker supported Naughty's position. DAVESDAVY stated that he would stay in the tower as long as he could, but he wanted to move supplies elsewhere. 

After over an hour, the Templars were getting weary. They constantly had to plug up holes in the tower walls from the TNT cannon, each one putting them in jeopardy of being breached. However, one particular hole happened to slip their attention for a few second, which was enough time for Legenzeryfuries to slip into the base. Legenzeryfuries ran around in the base attacking all of the people on the floor. One of the Templars with an invisibility potion and a diamond sword, combined with the efforts of Cannonwalker and the other Templars, made Legen exit through the hole he entered and swim away.

As the tides started to turn and the Templars seemed to be getting the upper hand over the invaders, Elitecraft had to shut down for maintenace due to issues with the system. However, when it came back to &quot;working order&quot; the factions system was broken. Cannonwalker and the other Templars couldn't open the chests in their base or even edit the terrain, causing them to have to search for other places to play on.

===Post-Attack Reconstruction===
On the eve of June 14, Captain_Naughty notified Cannonwalker and the other Templars that Elitecraft's faction issues had been resolved; the Templars were free to resume building. Due to the leaders of factions needing to be reassigned, Captain_Naughty re-assumed control over the Templars from ViceroyRobert. Naughty, BaronVonShush, and Cannonwalker got onto Elitecraft and began working to make the base invasion-proof; this way, Entendre and any other faction couldn't get in like they had on the 12th.

Naughty and Baron put a roof on the base and covered the tower with water. ViceroyRobert built a small obsidian bunker on top of the tower that could be exited but not entered. Cannonwalker and the others set homes in the obsidian bunker, which was then also covered in water. Cannonwalker worked on patching the holes Entendre had put in their base and was later assisted by Naughty. By the morning of June 15, the base was in better shape than ever before. As of now the Templars are digging down to bedrock to fortify the tower from underground as well; this way enemy factions, such as Entendre, can't get up through the bottom.

===The Looters Invasion===
About an hour before what was to be a successful attack by the looters, Mallace overheard Kidraskul, leader of Hundreds, fighting with Legen. Legen repetedly stated &quot;YOU SET A HOME NEAR OUR BASE&quot; with Kidraskul constantly denying. Finally, on his intelligence puppet, August Petrova, Mallace contacted Kidraskul, offering money and items in return for the location of Entendres base, seeing through his lies of denial. After negotiations, August gave kid a mob spawner in exchange for a tpa into their base. 

August arrived about 20m outside of &quot;enemy&quot; territory. As soon as he arrived, he detected Legen and Bren, the two members of Entendre right away. Sadly, they did to. Almost immediately, Entendre was disbanned and they fled. It was mysterious. He knew they were friends of the looters, but this location seemed on. Then, he saw the looters. He set a home and quickly ran back for armor. He then called for the cavalry, and minutes later the battle would begin. Within minutes, 3 other templars had arrived, and the bloodshed started. 
On the evening of June 17 (circa 7:30 PM EST) The attack began. Cannonwalker was the first to answer the call. The attack began with Mallace and Parax killing the 2 younger members, while Cannonwalker and Peter breached the older 2 members. Parax and Mallace then quickly secured the area looking for more while Cannonwalker and Pete held off the other 2. 

The four Templars started by repeatedly killing MicroWazzle and EZenner. Wazzle was scrambling to get all of the things in the base's chests out but the Templars proved to be too strong; Cannonwalker was able to get in one kill to each. After the base had been cleared of the two faction members Cannonwalker guarded their obsidian-covered chest room while Mallace went back to the Templars base to put things away. When Mallace returned, Cannonwalker went back to the base to do the same. The Looters then disbanded and reformed quickly, leaving the entirely base under no claim.

When Cannonwalker returned, Mallace ordered the group to begin mining in the chest room so they could take the obsidian back home. After a few minutes, when all of the obsidian was mined, Mallace ordered Baron, Cannonwalker and Funnyguy to take all of the torches from the wall as well; this way, if the Looters were to return they'd come back to a surprise fight with enemy mobs. As the group was taking down the torches, Mallace stood still in shock as he discovered a surprising twist; signs around a doorway saying &quot;Entendre.&quot; This hinted at the probability of the Looters' base originally belonging to Entendre, which meant the Templars were getting closer to their revenge. Cannonalker went back to their base excited at this new discovery, knowing all the well that the Templars may soon be knocking at Entendre's front doors.

Following the discovery, Mallace began an intensive intelligence mission with August Petrova and his other alternatives along with alter-egos provided by Goldtimbers to infiltrade Entendre and surrounding factions. The success is yet to be determined, but remember, any information whatsoever is vital.

==Recent History==
It is unknown when Terrorvale was founded, but many years ago, there lived two potent members of the community: a man named John, and his son Israphel. Israphel died at the hands of creepers, but founded his secret ocult's castle under Terrorvale. Since then, members of the community have come and gone. It was only recently that Old_Peculier had fled to Terrorvale to escape Israphel, and found the love of his life, Daisy_Duke. Not being able to handle his depression, Peculier planned to poison himself, but the heroes [[Honeydew]] and [[Xephos]] appeared on the horizon, forcing him to postpone it. During the heroes visit, much happened, and Terrorvale was abandoned.

==History==
Many years ago, in the little village of [[Terrorvale]], there was a young man named Israphel. He lived there with his father, Reverend_John. Israphel lived in a small hobbit-like bungalow just outside St. Creeper's. Sadly, one day, Israphel was overrun (ironically) by creepers, and killed. A few years later, a man named Bob moved to Terrorvale, and bought the house. He was never seen much, but it was assumed he became a follower of Israphel soon after.

The heroes [[Honeydew]] and [[Xephos]] came across this house in their adventure to Terrorvale, but never entered it.

&lt;/span&gt;

theZewery is a Finnish Minecraft player who LOVES parkour, croissants and magma cubes. His mission is to destroy all the chickens before they steal the Jelly Heart of Vigor in New-Stania. (Which is a made up country near Australia) To do that, he must go through many parkour courses, rescue many villages, destroying chicken bases and, of course, defeating many chicken commanders.

He is also a member of MCI (MineCraft Inspectors)

==The Servers==
theZewery plays often on multiplayer servers and sometimes he even starts to troll and grief in survival servers (NOTE: he does not grief/troll so badly. He just says other players to come to him to get a great reward. When a player reaches him, theZewery just says: Bye bye! And leaves) Once, while playing in a parkour server, he was just about finishing the map when he suddenly fell. On the ground, he started to look around and he discovered a hole in the wall. He used that hole to go out of map and he found a hidden parkour map outside the real map. He then went to a place that he has seen earlier and when other players saw him in there, they all asked: &quot;How did you get in there??&quot; If you want to see him in the server, come to this IP: &lt;span style=&quot;color:rgb(51,51,51);font-family:arial,sans-serif;line-height:17px;&quot;&gt;play.itsjerryandharry.com He will usually be in the parkour section.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;color:rgb(51,51,51);font-family:arial,sans-serif;line-height:17px;&quot;&gt;NOTE: Finland's time zone is +2&lt;/span&gt;
==&lt;span style=&quot;color:rgb(51,51,51);font-family:arial,sans-serif;line-height:17px;&quot;&gt;MCI&lt;/span&gt;==
&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:17px;&quot;&gt;MCI is a group that solves problems in Minecraft.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:17px;&quot;&gt;There is currently 3 members in it (4 if counted the pet Magma Cube) this is the list:&lt;/span&gt;
*&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:17px;&quot;&gt;Hayate Sani (The leader)&lt;/span&gt;
*&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:17px;&quot;&gt;theZewery/ZeweryCrafter MC (The mission solver)&lt;/span&gt;
*&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:17px;&quot;&gt;Utski Kowawski (NPC Villager, &quot;does&quot; the paper work)&lt;/span&gt;

==Weaknesses==
Unfortunately, theZewery is VERY addicted to croissants and could do anything to have one. Other players can lure him somekind of trap with croissants (Golden Carrots)

However, he is very skilled at avoiding traps and can steal the croissant from the trap (must be a super trap to trap Zewery) For example: Pressure plate in middle of iron doors: theZewery will sneak next to the pressure plate and take the carrot (croissant) without activating the plate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1232">The Ares dimension, shrouded in mystery, is quite literally a hidden planet residing above the Overworld. The only way to enter Ares is by locating an Ares portal, a natural structure that is randomly generated on Mushroom biomes (1 portal per island).



[[File:Portal.png|frame|left|An Ares Portal, naturally generated and not yet activated.]]






















==Ares Porta==
The portal, when naturally generated, has to be activated to work.

'''Requirements:'''
#No blocks may be missing from the portal. This includes the Quartz, red stone, emeralds, and sponges (some blocks may be missing; these must be restored).
#No mobs or entities can be on the structure, excluding the player or players.
#No parts of the structure may be obscured by blocks, ex. Hills bleeding on to the portal.
'''Activation:'''
#Remove the sponges.
#Restore any missing pieces of the portal.
#Under the sponges are two Redstone blocks. Use flint and steel to ignite both. Then, quickly move off of the portal structure.
#After the fire extinguishers, all center blocks of the structure (nether quartz ore, emerald, and Redstone) will become portal blocks. Jump in to enter.

'''The Black Warrior '''was a ship built by [[Cannonwalker]] on the server [[GabeWorld]].
==History==
Cannonwalker began construction on the Black Warrior during his first day playing on GabeWorld. He made a long dirt path away from mainland and made a wooden frame. Then, after much grueling work over the next few days (although this was heavily alleviated with the help of an admin called &quot;Kazuma&quot;) the ship itself was complete. Later on, Cannonwalker would build the masts and [[AwesomeA321]] would help with the sails.

&lt;gallery type=&quot;slideshow&quot;&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Although the ship was originally only going to serve as Cannonwalker's home and his nether wart farm (as a source of income), the formation of [[Team Piston]] brought upon it another task; serving as Team Piston's oceanic headquarters. With this change in purpose AwesomeA321, [[Jeremiah Garland|Captain_Naughty]] and [[Parax|BaronVonShush]] would become crew member (at least to some extent) on board the ship. However, GabeWorld was closed down sometime in May 2014 and along with it the ship went.

*Cannonwalker's home
*Team Piston's sea headquarters
*Nether wart farm
==Crew Members==
*Cannonwalker (Captain)
*AwesomeA321
*Captain_Naughty
*BaronVonShush
==Trivia==
*The name &quot;the Black Warrior&quot; comes from a ship Cannonwalker owned in a pirate-themed game, &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean Online&quot;
*The ship was eventually moved away from Savica and Alberta (AlReyesSpark's town) by an admin and put in the middle of the ocean at the request of Cannonwalker

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1407">'''The Brethren Coast''' (officially '''BrethrenCoast''') is a faction based out of the MCNations server. It was founded and is currently lead by [[Cannonwalker]].
==History==
The creation of a &quot;Brethren Coast&quot; first occurred on July 7. Cannonwalker, with the help of [[AlReyesSpark]], was able to acquire a nation in MCNations consisting of a few Caribbean islands. Cannonwalker immediately recruited [[AwesomeA321]], [[Ned Edgewalker]] and [[Rocket 93]] to the Brethren Coast, making his nation one of the largest in terms of numbers. Cannonwalker soon expanded his territory both with more help from AlReyesSpark and ObsidianVader's entry into the Brethren Coast, which allowed Cannonwalker to trade his former country away for more land. A player by the name of ErixeyaOfficial also joined the Brethren Coast, requiring a nation to base his own operations out of it.

The MCNations server officially opened on August 8. Cannonwalker got onto the server on August 12 and created the official Brethren Coast faction, inviting his four men into it. ErixeyaOfficial hasn't officially joined yet, however.
==Membership==
*[[Cannonwalker]] (President)
*[[AwesomeA321]] (Vice President)
*[[Rocket 93]]
*[[Ned Edgewalker]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4066">'''The Brotherhood of the Golden Pants '''is a player group based out of the server &quot;Minedlands.&quot; The group is currently lead by Cannonwalker, since he is in possession of the island claims.
==History==
Cannonwalker, AwesomeA321 and Captain_Naughty all started out as members of a large man-made island, accompanied by many of their friends. However, as Cannonwalker and Naughty started to grow discontent with life on the island they decided to sail away and form their own separate societies; Cannonwalker formed the Brotherhood, while Naughty formed Windforth. &lt;gallery type=&quot;slideshow&quot;&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

While Windforth was a Nordic-themed village in the extreme hills biome, the Brotherhood was an underground base built on a very small island (too small to even build a house on). AwesomeA, one of Cannonwalker's friends, showed interest in Cannonwalker's new society and Cannonwalker invited him to join it. Captain_Naughty would also join later on, resulting in the discovery of an abandoned mineshaft underneath the base.

Although the base was originally abandoned (to some extent) after the members migrated to Elitecraft to join the [[Templars (Faction)]] the group's disillusionment with life in Elitecraft caused them to migrate back on June 29th, 2014, bringing along with them new recruit Ned_Edgewalker.

Eventually, BaronVonShush, another member of the Brotherhood, took to creating specially enchanted armor, acquiring already enchanted pieces from the island's mob grinder. In time, however, the Brotherhood began running out of room to store armor pieces that hadn't been merged yet; to rectify the problem, BaronVonShush decided to enchant books instead so that he could get better enchantments quicker. In addition, he wanted to build a library on the island. Sadly, most of the cows in the Minedlands had been killed off or sealed away where Baron couldn't get to them. This made it extremely difficult to find a source of leather for books.

First, Baron sailed off the coast of the island in hopes of finding a new continent; if he was lucky, the cows there wouldn't have been killed off. However, after hours of traveling, Baron gave up and returned. He set off again, this time for a nearby island that hadn't been touched yet; again, he found nothing. Baron  proceeded to search the main continent of the Minedlands, and after several more hours of exploring the entire thing, he came across a small herd that had not yet been killed. Immediately, he claimed a small area and created a small building; inside, he planted wheat and carrots so that he could feed himself and his newly-captured cows. For an extended period of time, Baron killed the offspring of the cows for leather, but he also helped raise them into adulthood and released them into the wilderness, hoping to repopulate the continent.

==Name Origin==
The name &quot;Brotherhood of the Golden Pants&quot; was thought one night on the island. Cannonwalker had been thinking of leaving the island and so happened to kill a zombie with golden armor. Cannonwalker received the golden armor pants it was wearing and decided that &quot;this is what my new society will be about.&quot; Why Cannonwalker is so fond of the golden pants, nobody knows.

== Prologue: The Beginning==

Once, in the land of Rockton Peaks, there lived a mighty hero named Stonecoon. Stonecoon hailed from an ancient race of Earthen Racoons that were wiped out by an invasion of cave spiders and creepers. The only way he survived was to think ahead and make secret escape tunnels, in case something like this should happen. With his home and friends gone, he had to start a new life without them unbeknownst of the dangers of the outside world...

==Chapter 1: A New Home==
Once he knew he was a safe distance from the village, he decided to explore the new land. Near the bottom of a hill, he found a small NCP Village. The villagers seemed friendly, so he decided to live there. &quot;You're not from around here, are you?&quot; A villager asked.

&quot;No, I'm not&quot; replied Stonecoon.

&quot;Then who are you?&quot;

&quot;I am Stonecoon, the last known Earthen Raccon around!&quot; He said in a heroic, booming voice.

&quot;The ''last ''one?&quot;

&quot;The last one.&quot;

&quot;What happened to the others?&quot;

&quot;They were wiped out by an army of creepers and cave spiders.&quot;

&quot;Oh... Well if you want to live here, there's an empty house in the center of the village.&quot;

&quot;And I can have it?&quot;

&quot;Yep.&quot;

&quot;Thanks!&quot; he said as he ran off to find his new home.

When he got there, he saw that it was the biggest house in the village. ''I wonder why they would just give me the biggest house in their village? ''He thought. But it was late so he decided to think about it in the morning.

== Chapter 2: ''Coming Soon!''==
''Check back later!''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="510">The Creeper War was an enormous war that lasted 100 years. It was the entire Minecraftian continent vs. the massive Creeper Army. It was one of the most dangerous and longest wars in Minecraftian history, lasting from 1800 to 1899. The Creepers had highly advanced technology that was similar to that of the Nazis. The war ended when Minecraftian General Destroyer_Of_Creepers999 managed to blow up the Creepers' flagship, causing the Creeper Army to retreat. The war was over, and the Minecraftians had won. </text>

The ship is made of dark wood, with red sails that have a white rose painted across it. The ship contains no broadsides, and a cannon on each side. The ship was sailed alone by Rocket to the island of Vix,  sailed on with [[Cannonwalker]] when he sailed to Fort Mahogany, and lastly when he had sailed to Gabe's Landing. He then sailed with the rest of the members of the [[Black Bandana Crew]].The ship was used only a few times, from the time that Rocket left his home village, to when his crew was gifted the [[The Transcending Trinity|Transcending Trinity]] for when Rocket saved a small village known as &quot;Redwood Village.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;The ship is lost to the sea, and is considered a fortune. The current reward for recovering the Rose is a whopping three billion dollars. The ship has been lost for years, and is not expected to be salvaged from the ocean's treachery.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1471">==Origin==
The Crusaders were the first and largest faction to settle in the land of &quot;DraftCraft,&quot; and were a peaceful few. They had begun on an unknown date, when a player, AwesomeA321, decided to create a faction named the &quot;Sausages.&quot; He then decided it would be a good idea to make a treehouse as his home. His friends, DAVESDAVY and Rocket_93 joined in. They built most of the treehouse, as they were skilled builders. Rocket_93 then made a deal with Awesome. If he renamed the Faction to something more serious, he would join. Thus, the Crusaders were born.
==Rise and Extension==
As time went on, Rocket made extensions to the treebase, and soon, the Crusaders made an alliance with another faction known as the &quot;Minenauts.&quot; It consisted of two people, Agent__M and Captain_Naughty. Also, people began to join the Crusaders, but a sad time came. Rocket grew bored of the faction and left. However, the next member to have been in the faction longest took his place as Co-Leader, a boy named Krisrufin, but little did Awesome know deceit would follow.
==Downfall==
The Crusaders were having a tough time, but that didn't stop them. Kris and Awesome had grown to be friends. However, one day, Kris started to grief the treehouse, and did much damage before Awesome noticed and killed him. However, the damage that was done could not be repaired, so Awesome disbanded the faction and the Crusaders had come to an end.

== &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Background ==

The Dark Omen is a Wither created by Parax millennia ago. However, the Dark Omen differs from other Withers in terms of appearance and abilities. While other Withers are a floating, three-headed, armless torso of a skeleton, the Dark Omen possesses arms and a tail, is considerably darker in color, and has glowing, green eyes. In the case of powers, the Dark Omen possesses the same powers as its master, while its Wither brethren are very limited, being able to only teleport, regenerate, and fire explosive, ghostly skulls. In addition, the Dark Omen is a single entity and mind, rather than being conjoined triplets like the other Withers.

== &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;History ==

Time unknown. Parax had journeyed to Minecraftia when it was barely settled. Here, he began creating creatures that would roam the realm, serving him and defending treasures that most would consider valuable. At some point, he became interested in Withers, and proceeded with an experiment to create one by performing the proper ritual. He created a pile of Soul Sand and sculpted &quot;arms&quot; onto it. After enchanting it with copies of his own abilities, Parax placed on it 3 skulls of Wither Skeletons that he had defeated in the Nether. Within seconds, the totem was disintegrated, and in its place was a dark, skeletal, three-headed creature. But with Parax's modifications, this monster was different than its brethren. A loud booming sound rang out with the Wither's creation, and the Dark Omen was born.

Parax needed not say anything for the Dark Omen to declare him its master. With its creation, it vowed to serve only its maker and carry out his will. Parax released it out into the wild, allowing it to do what it wishes, only to come to him and do his bidding when he so wishes. With that done, the Dark Omen set off, imposing destruction on settlements and gathering resources and riches, piling them all in one secret chamber far underground.


== &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Traits and Resurrection ==

The Dark Omen possesses many features, some that other Withers have, and others that they do not have. These traits include regeneration, flying, teleportation, arms, a tail, long, skeletal necks, speech, Parax's own abilities, and even resurrection. With its creation, Parax integrated an enchantment onto its Nether Star before merging it with the Dark Omen.

The result of the enchanted Nether Star was that, upon death, it would be dropped for collecting. Those who possess the Nether Star will be given vast, unimaginable power, something that has tempted many future victims of the Dark Omen to hunt it, though none prevailed. However, should someone without a strong mind attempt to use the star, they will bend to the will of the Dark Omen, whose soul resides within the Nether Star upon death. By then, it is only a matter of minutes before the Dark Omen is resurrected, destroying the enthralled victim in the process and reabsorbing the Nether Star. As the Nether Star is indestructible, this makes it impossible to kill the Dark Omen permanently; all one can do is hide the Nether Star and hope that nobody finds it.

== &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Trivia ==
*I have sculpted a model of the Dark Omen in real life.
*Not to be confused with the Dark One, a non-dangerous Wither residing outside Parax/BaronVonShush's house.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2559">==The Death of Herobrine is a story about terrovale the day they raided the Israhpel's Castle and what happend to Terrovale.==

== Chapter 1 The Traitor==

The Death of Herobrine when they killed Israphel the church was destroyed the entrance was blocked so that the portal to the nether could'nt be revealed and the villager named Herobrine turned evil. When the adventures Honeydew and Xephos came back from there journey into the hill they saw him Herobrine. When they saw him they could'nt believe that he survived but he did. He faked being good so he could gain their trust but they saw something suspicious that he was the man that lived on the hill in the house on the hill that was infested by monsters.

==Chapter 2 Ender Fighter==
Then Herobrine bated them into the monster trap that was made to keep monsters out of the village. The adventures Honeydew and Xephos didn't take the bate instead they said &quot;let's go to the blacksmith's quaters and made new armour for them then Herobrine thought that he could bait them through the Ender Portal They went in but so did Herobrine they battled the Ender Dragon and killed it. They took the Dragon Egg with them back through the portal Herobrine was furious with himself so he thougt of taking a trip to Notch.

==Chapter 3 The Challenge ==
Then he asked Notch if so he was helping the adventurers Honeydew and Xephos Notch said &quot;they are the good guys like you once were but they know what's right unlike you so they fight to help all there race&quot;. From this Herobrine was very mad he tried to fight Notch so he challenged Notch to a PvP arena battle.


==Chapter 4 The Battle of the Arena ==
Herobrine had skill with close range weapons but Notch had the Hammer of Notch and he is good with a bow.The day of the battle they said iron armour and diamond swords only unless you go mining and find stuff for enchantindg or better armour.Whe the battle began there was no wall around the arena so they could rome freely and all around the world. When the battle began they fought but Herobrine new he ouldn't win so he used his ironic speed to get away.Notch didn't like this he posponed the game and banned Heobrine from Minecraftia and killed him.His soul is now a glitchy thing in the world but the only thing that can now kill him totally is the Hammer of Notch.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1183">The Ender Sacrificial Cremation (The ESC) is a sacrificial ceremony which requires the burning of a human being to bring life back to a killed enderman. The human was chosen out in the past by his Owner, Landlord or the King. In more modern times like today the Human is a volunteer and has to go through some tests first.



==The History of the ESC==


421BCE. (Indev 1.3) - The ESC was created when certain Enders in the Lodstykk (Law-Stik) Region discovered                                     a type of cure for the Endermen dying in the Resistance war between the Enders and                                       the Humans. 

423BCE. (Indev 1.3_2) - End of Resistance War caused the downfall of this technique however some small                                           Ender cult groups continued the use

72AD. (Alpha 0.12) -  Notch allows the technique to become legal in the full world of Minecraftia however the                                         human must be a volunteer to stop the slaughtering of helpless citizens

==His Story==
The Enderman was once a normal Minecrafter like you and me. Then everything changed....

===Chapter 1===
Everything started out normal for John (Enderman) that day. He woke up from his much needed rest. The night before he had found diamonds in his mine. But then he remembered something... A strange dream he had. He had a dream that he was walking through an unknown forest unlike anything forest he had seen before, almost like something out of Minecraft Alpha. On the ground he found a strange pearl and when he looked forward he saw [[Herobrine|Herobrine!]] He couldn't remember what happened next. He went to his chest to get the diamonds he had found, he was eager to craft a diamond pick. His jaw dropped when he saw what was inside...

===Chapter 2===
[[File:Sh.jpg|frame|The forest in his dream.]]Inside was the pearl from his dreams. John started to wonder if it was a dream. Questions swirled in his mind, Then things went black. When he awoke it was nightfall. He stood up, But something was different. He felt taller, Quite taller actually. He went to his chest, The pearl was still there. He decides he needs to find out how he got it, Was the dream actually a dream, Did he just pick it up randomly? He didn't know. The next morning he went for a walk through the forest. He only walked when he wanted to think about something, While he walked he thought about a dragon, a black one that resides in a place called &quot;The End&quot; He didn't understand why that thought came across his mind, Perhaps he never will. He decided to mine. He dug down until he saw a cave. A little joy was brought to him when he saw diamonds. But he heard footsteps behind him, He checked his difficulty. Peaceful. Scared to turn around he ran forward. Not looking where he was going, he clumsily fell into a hole...

He awoke, in his bed... But how? Was it a dream? He had a bruise on his leg and blood on his head. It couldn't of been a dream. He went into third person and screamed. His skin was darker now, a dark grew, his legs were definitely longer than any other minecraft character's. He decided to ignore it...

===Chapter 3===
He decided to go onto his favorite faction server, He had full diamond gear and an awesome base. He logged on, he didn't have any of his items of his items... Surprised, He pressed T to try and talk to his faction, but the chat box didn't show up. He tried again and again... Nothing. It was raining outside. When he went out he took some damage. He quickly logged off...

===Chapter 4===
On his Single player world things we're stranger. He was not even close to his home, at first he was scared... He had no inventory. His hot bar only had 2 slots. One with the strange pearl and one with nothing, When he picked up any block it couldn't stack. He pressed F5, He was completely black, His eyes were purple, He was tall, And he was hungry... He logged on the server, and he saw a Person, and the person saw him. He looked at the human, The Human looked at him. When the human ran, he suddenly appeared behind him...
He wasn't human anymore, He was part of the game now... He was... An Enderman.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="936">
The unnoficial First War of Minecraftia reportedly began on January 4th when an army of Iron Golems branded with the name &quot;APERTURE&quot; charged onto varying lands of Minecraftia, seeking to destroy all who stand in their way and occupy towns and cities across the land. Mysterious figure Josef Furnace is blamed for the occuptation, however he denies any involvement with the attacks and has not made any official statements. Genetically mutated creatures such as Zombie Pigmen and Skeletons have also been seen attacking, all of which share almost identical behavior  of past Aperture specimens.



Actual conflict began much before the official war, involving small rebel forces such as the NCR and those who refer to themselves simply as &quot;rebels,&quot; however none of the groups are active at this time. The war at the time is simply referred to as occupupation, as little resistance has been shown against the Golems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1910">'''The Hessian''' was a ruthless and bloodthirsty German soldier. His real name is unknown, he grew up in Berlin. The was a 1st lieutenant upon his death. He was born in 1749. Much of his childhood was unknown, but at the age of 17, he was drafted into the German army.
==Equipment==
The Hessian carried basic German army gear, such as a backpack full of medical supplies, a musket, with a silver bayonet, that had a bloodstain on it, later, in the 1780s, it was replaced with a golden bayonet, that had a golden trigger. He also carried a hand-axe. Last of all, he carried a stone dirk, it wasn't a fine material, having a jagged blade, for more serious wounds, the dirk was never cleaned, which made a slice even more deadly from it.
*His bayonet was a French model, handmade in 1768. He carried it with a silver bayonet, until the late 1780s, upon reaching 1st lieutenant.
*The hand-axe he carried was large, and broad. He would only use it if he was battling someone in armor, to break off pieces of the armor with ease, leaving open a blow from his stone dirk.
*The Hessian's stone dirk was purposely made of a more poor material, for more painful attacks, along with the jagged blade, making more than one main incision. The dirk was never cleaned, it was rumored that if you were ever stabbed by it and lived, you would fall to blood poisoning.
==The Jägermeister==
The Hessian was a very heavy alcoholic in his lifetime, he lost all of his family due to unknown reasons. He joined the German army in the hopes of doing his part in this world. He often drank Jägermeister alcohol, the other corporals would call him &quot;The Jägermeister&quot; as a nickname, for such. He did not take very kindly to this, but it eventually was used between the ranks more than his real name.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2565">'''The Island '''is a giant island on the server Minedlands. While the Island was originally an archipelago of three islands, they were connected with dozens of stacks of dirt by the inhabitants as to allow more room for building.
==History==
After the closing of [[GabeWorld]], Cannonwalker, Rocket_93, Squirto19 and Captain_Naughty decided to try out a new server Cannonwalker had stumbled upon; Minedlands. As most Minecraftians would do, they immediately ventured out into the forest in hopes of finding uninhabited land to begin their settlement on. After a long travel of seeing nothing but inhabited land, the group reached the coastline. They spent the night in a small room built into the side of the mountain and set sail the next morning.

The four all decided to go in separate directions and notify each other if they found suitable land for the new settlement. After a while of seemingly nothing Cannonwalker encountered an archipelago of three islands; he notified Squirto19, who came over as quick as possible. The two decided to dedicate one of the islands to carrot and sugar cane farming. Cannonwalker decided to dedicate another one of the islands to a tree farm (this island would also be home to the entrance to the mine).&lt;gallery type=&quot;slideshow&quot;&gt;
2014-05-31_23.29.29.png|A view of one of the original islands from afar during construction

2014-05-31_23.30.23.png|The carrot/sugar cane farm island during construction
&lt;/gallery&gt;

As others began migrating to the island (just about everybody on the inhabitants list below), they began filling the space between the archipelago with dirt. Within a couple of days, the archipelago of three small islands transformed into one giant island that was one block thick in the center. Almost immediately after the completion of the man-made aspect of the terrain, Dirty_Mallace began building a large tower in the center of the island to dive in the water below from; some of the terrain had not been filled in. It was around this time that Cannonwalker decided he wanted to form [[The Brotherhood of the Golden Pants|his own society]].

'''''Rest to be added by Dirty_Mallace or any other inhabitant of the island.'''''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2101">The League of Warriors was once a great faction of some of the most elite people in minecraft. Many members were once trouble makers, liers, stealers, and murderers. Many of them were part of the Morocco and Raiders clan, which both were ancient factions and towns. The warriors lived in many places due to the mythical mob &quot;Lord Herobrine&quot; which was summoned by the enemy.... Prefrence. Herobrine was first sited in a abandoned mineshaft by Miner. He sealed up the cave and thought it was done forever. But Herobrine stalked Miner, and he eventually stalked him to his home with the warriors. Herobrine destroyed everything and the warriors moved to a plains land, and they lived inside a mountain. Not much happened there except for the attacks by Prefrence. The world was then changed to the old world where Morocco and Raiders once resided. They decided to live at the raiders old city, where they lived peacefully until a spy came in and destroyed the city. The harbinger, Dcomando15, thought that a moderator had destoryed the city until he knew this person was framed. The man decided to take vengeance and entered the enemy guild and TNTed their town. Soon, the warriors took to the sky, where the harbinger made a sky city! There, in the city, was a memorial and story of the warriors. It told the story of the warriors up to that point. All of a sudden, a member disappears. Miner, stalked by Herobrine, was captured by him, Herobrine, himself. The Harbinger, Dcomando, and Dirty_Mallace searched everywhere. They came upon their old city, and found a note. They figured out that the moderator was murdered by Herobrine. Then all of a sudden, a couple days later, the world is shut down. But the story is not over yet.... for the warriors are spread out across the world of minecraftia, searching for each other.

==Dec. 17th, 2010==
Today, here at Mojang, I've added a new update to the indie game I created, called &quot;Minecraft.&quot; I plan to release it to the public on the 20th. It is simple, but fun. It revolves around the survival of the player, and the whole game is based on old retro &quot;pixel&quot; video games. The only difference between it and them, is that this game is 3D,and is much larger. Although I am proud of finishing development on the game, I am still grieving the loss of my dear brother, Herobrine. Hopefully, the release will be so popular it will take my mind off of his death.


==Dec. 20th, 2010==
The game was a huge success! Its already sold many copies! We celebrated at Mojang and hope to add many future updates! I already have new ideas for the game! I'm so excited, I can hardly hold it in!
==Dec.31st, 2010==
Its a great way to end the year! I added many new patches to the game, however, many fans are reporting odd glitches, and an entity similar to the player themself. I must look into this, but I'll do it some other time, for now, I'm going to relax and celebrate the new year!
==Jan. 15th, 2011==
I've been looking into this &quot;ghostly entity&quot; and am quite concerned. I'm afraid of whether I've gone insane or what people are saying is true. The entity is the basic player skin, &quot;Steve,&quot; except with white (supposedly glowing) eyes. A forum post was created on the Mojang wbesite about it, and the player who created the post says an account by the name of my deceased brother, &quot;Herobrine&quot; keeps sending messages telling him to stop, and that the forum keeps disappearing. I've searched the website all over, but there is no account named &quot;Herobrine.&quot; The only proof that the player has of this entity is a picture with him in the distance. I am confused and a bit scared, and I am wondering whether this is some kind of jokester, if it really could relate to my brother or even (hopefully not) BE him. I'll check back on this issue soon.
==February 22, 2011==
Today, I added the update &quot;1.3&quot; to Minecraft, and have been trying to take my mind off of this &quot;Herobrine&quot; entity. I'm having trouble doing so, though, because more and more people are starting to wonder. I have told admins on the site to ignore any talk of him or to try and end it. I'd like to keep this a secret, and to investigate this on my own. Various things have been popping up thata re supposedly ways to summon &quot;him.&quot; I've tried many, but none will work...

==March 22, 2011==
I'm horribly scared. I made a totem using gold blocks and netherrack that looks like a straight pole. I then lit the top on fire and lightning struck all around and on the top. A message appeared saying &quot;Herobrine has joined the server,&quot; even though I'm in single-player. A message then followed saying,&quot;Hello, brother. I see you summoned me, what for?&quot; I immediately exited the game, and haven't entered that world since.
==May ??, 2011==
I have to enter again. Something's drawing me to it. I can't stop it. He wants me there. He deleted my other worlds. My server's won't connect, either. Whenever I think of the game, his message pops up in my head. I must return and finish this once and for all.
==November 17th, 2011==
I can't do it anymore. I entered the world and spawned in the nether. Herobrine was staring directly at me, and he looked just as people described him. I looked at him and asked why he was scaring people and entering and leaving there worlds. He said he had found a way into a limbo. He may have died, but his spirit lived on, so, when we released Minecraft, he was a virus released with it. He had driven people insane, and scared others out of playing and even deleting the game. After being summoned by me, he decided there was one thing to do; kill me. We had a fight in-game, and I won, but he didn't respawn. Pistons opened up and I dropped down into a dark hallway that lead to a nether portal. I left the nether and appeared not in a portal, but next to my in-game bed. A sign next to it said &quot;I'll be back.&quot;

So, I made a decision. Tomorrow, I'm going to step down and hand the baton to Jeb. He seems like a worthy man, and Herobrine doesn't care for him. Until Herobrine returns, I will go on like usual, hopefully being able to forget this incident. But I know I'll never forget. He's there. He always was. He'll never leave. He's like bedrock. Nobody can break him. No one but me.
===''THE END''===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1177">This is a story of good and evil, of light and darkness, and of Ender-Pearls. It all started with war...

Evil monsters from another world called &quot;The End&quot;, attacked. The great kings defeated them, and, as a peace offering, the people of the end (Endermen) made 12 Ender-Pearls. Three Pearls for the Immortals, the great kings, three for the villagers, odd little men, three for the mobs, stupid monsters, and three for mortal lords, doomed to wither as skeletons. However, one amidst them was to betray them all, and his name was Jason Chainblade. He was the eldest of the Immortals, wise, handsome, charming. His Pearl had taken over his mind, but he hid his madness from all he met, except for one man, Will Ironfang, a fellow Immortal. He never trusted Jason, and now, Jason had gone out of his mind. His suspicions confirmed when he saw him go into a soul sucking, evil, dark hole of death, (aka The Nether) and in the molten lava, he reformed his Ender-Pearl into a device of evil, which he called... the Eye Of Ender!

One Pearl to rule them all,
One Pearl to find them,
One Pearl to bring them all
And in the darkness, bind them.

More coming soon!

Most often called the Meeting of the Golems, Josef Furnace held a meeting with the most intelligent of his iron creations, along with his human followers. In this meeting, Furnace ordered his creations to spread out across Olexia and beyond and claim large regions under the name of Aperture. The meeting notably had several spies watching, whom's alleigance was with New Elgin.



Deep under the iron mines of Mycelia...

Igor, Josef's assistant, held up the head of a beheaded golem.

&quot;'''The humans were waiting for us at the town, master. Some''' '''how they... ''knew,&quot; '''''the golem proclaimed. Another golem from the back joined in. &quot;'''We would advise delaying the secret attack on New Elgin through''' '''old mineshaft until their guard dies down.&quot; '''The golem suggested.

&quot;Mm, would you. And, just so I'm clear, you would advise wasting precious time because of some heretofore 'tactical mastermind&quot; in their ranks, who has been feeding them information by walking up to the mountain and sticking his ear in a hole, and on top of that every rebel clan from eastern Olexia is waiting for us right now, all crammed inside the tiny comfines of the town.&quot; There was a long pause. Finally, one golem responded positively.



'''''BADDABOOP. ''&quot;Affirmative.&quot;'''



Furnace rolled his eyes. &quot;You... are imbeciles. But I blame myself. Because I created you.&quot;

'''&quot;ALL HAIL THE MAKER!&quot;''' All the golems exclaimed simultaneously.

&quot;Ah, the hailing circuit. My one moment of weakness.&quot; Furnace said, flattered. &quot;Very well, you worthless piles of iron. New Elgin will be spared for the time being. Let them rally all their forces to protect a doomed little village. But as long as they are there, every outpost in southern Olexia is vulnerable.&quot; Josef thought for one moment.

&quot;Take them all. Occupy all of southern Olexia, then we will be able to strike from behind. Once we take the town, we move east towards Frozen LA, and pound it to the ground. Then, my creations... We take Minecraftia.&quot;



And without another word, every single Golem cleared out of the room, leaving only the loyal humans. Furnace gestured for them to leave, and then he reatreated to his quarters and began writing in an empty book. A cold chill was sent all across Olexia...

The Misfit Adventures of Rocket_93 are the planned out story of Rocket_93 and how he got lost in the forests of Minecraftia. These will be the tales of him surviving the best he can possibly survive.
==Chapter 1: Intro.==
Rocket_93 was just your average 15-year-old Minecraftian. He had no main features. He was always interested in mining and survival. He had a small family and were very poor. Rocket sometimes would venture into the woods, because it was better even there. He was a family of four; his father, Meteor O'craft, his mother, Lapis O'craft, himself, Rocket O'craft, (Named after his father as a pun to space science). And Rocket's little sister, Diamond O'craft. They were always a happy family. They never had any troubles until the 1.1 version, there was an attack at night from a charged creeper. Its victim was Meteor. Meteor did not survive the attack, he was laying in his bed. Lapis was locking the doors and the creeper sensed Meteor through the wall, it was a charged one so it instantly killed him. Everyone ran up the stairs to see what happened but it was too late; Meteor was all over the walls. Meteor lived a long life. He was born in the Minecraft demo. (In this story living through one Minecraft version would be one year, so Meteor was about maybe in his 40s). Rocket was shocked. This set off the worst thing ever thought of. He ran away into the forest. He never came back. Lapis and Diamond worried until Lapis was sick about it. Rocket was such a great survivor anyways, so there was nothing to worry about. But his mother and sister were too afraid to go search.

''&quot;Even when your kind appears to triumph ... Still we rise again. And do you know why? It is because the Order is born of a realization. We require no creed. No indoctrination by desperate old men. All we need is that the world be as it is. And THIS is why the Templars will never be destroyed.&quot;''
''-Josef Furnace Cross''

[[File:250px-Knights.png|right]]

The Templars of Minecraftia is an ancient order, dating back to the days of Notch. They are heavily inspired by the Knights Templar. The Templars believe that vast unclaimed land is a waste, and that freedom is, in  a way, fuel for chaos, and that organization and the power of Science is and always has been the true way of life. Notch to the Templars is the only true and powerful leader, enforcing his power on those who practice witchcraft and/or corrupted potion brewing (unless it is for science). Their base of operations is in the snowy  mountains of Angmar and the surrounding lands of Mycelia and other parts of Olexia. There are outposts throughout Minecraftia, in warm deserts and abandoned mineshafts.  The Templars disguised themselves as a science industry known as Aperture Co. to hide their true agenda, so they could strike at the right time.

Apparently the right time has already come, and the  Templars have been expanding lands by launching expeditions and occupying kingdoms across Minecraftia. This has caused the ongoing First War of Minecraftia, and kingdoms across the land are being forced to choose sides or suffer from financial and ration issues.

The Templars mostly consist of a small group of &quot;lords.&quot; The order grows daily, more and more knights taking the oath to Notch and the lords.

==The Reinvention of Monster Cookie==
''Before reading this story, read the first story I made, [[Monster Cookie]] and also my page [[AwesomeA321]]. ''

&quot;IT'S ALIVE!&quot;

The great doctor Ishnarp was working hard in his lab late at night, trying to resurrect his dead pet zombie, Frank. It had just sat up for a second, but looked at the doctor with wide eyes, and died again. The doctor went to his notes and recorded what had just happened. At that very moment, Ishnarp's newly hired intern, DirtMan walked in. &quot;Hi.&quot; He said, just standing at the entrance to the doctor's lab and staring. &quot;Hello.&quot; Ishnarp replied back. &quot;Do ya need anything?&quot; DirtMan asked. &quot;No, nothing at all.&quot; Ishnarp answered, sidetracked by his notes. &quot;Okie dokie.&quot; DirtMan said. He then turned to the table where the rotting corpse of Frank lay. &quot;What's this?&quot; The doctor looked up from his notes. He hesitated before saying,&quot;An.... experiment.&quot; DirtMan curiously poked Frank. He sat up, looked at him, and went &quot;Shhhh!&quot; He then lay back down, pretending to be dead. &quot;Err...&quot; DirtMan said. He then turned to walk out, but the doctor finished writing and looking over his notes and stopped him in his tracks. &quot;DirtMan, after looking over my notes, I noticed I'm missing one key ingredient. You.&quot; &quot;Me?&quot; DirtMan asked, a bit surprised. &quot;Yes. You see, I need a type of natural resource to use on the zombie. It seems to be scared of me, and giving it a natural resource may remind it of its birthplace, giving it a feeling of comfort. That's where you come in. I take a small chunk of your dirt, make it into a potion, and give it to the zombie.&quot; Said the doctor. &quot;Me?&quot; Repeated DirtMan. He was a bit worried, knowing that the last time he was used for an experiment, it didn't go so well (See &quot;The Bride Of DirtMan&quot;). The doctor stepped up to DirtMan, broke a chunk off of his shoulder, and then quickly ran over to the cauldron and dropped it in. &quot;Now, you may go.&quot; The doctor said, motioning towards the door. DirtMan exited the lab. The doctor then resumed his work.

Later that night, the doctor had decided to go to bed, as he was very tired. He exited the lab, but left the door wide open. Even later that night, a group of something had gotten into the lab. They bounced their way towards the cauldron, and when they where in front of it, the leader of the group shouted,&quot;Geronimo!&quot; and jumped in. The others followed, and the mixture sizzled and popped, and after a very long time, the remains of the creatures floated to the surface; Melted chocolate chips and cookie dough.

The next morning, the doctor went to the lab to find Frank in a different position than the day before. Ishnarp ignored this and went straight to the cauldron. He noticed a bit of discoloration, but just went on with adding ingredients. He soon finished the potion and called in DirtMan. &quot;I want you to witness the creation of secondhand life.&quot; Ishnarp walked over to the table and rolled his zombie over. He opened his mouth, took the cork off the potion, and poured it in. The zombie's eyes sprung open. It sat up. &quot;FINALLY!&quot; Ishnarp happily yelled.But something was amiss. The zombie wasn't moving. It started making grunting sounds. All of the sudden, it started to turn light brown. It then grew little bumps that looked like chocolate chips. &quot;W-what?&quot; The doctor was shocked and took a step back. The zombie then started to turn into a circle-ish shape. When he was changing, he looked like a giant cookie, but with a face. DirtMan immediately recognized this cookie, and grabbed the doctor, &quot;Wha-&quot; He said, but was cut off by DirtMan.&quot;No time to explain, we need to go.&quot; The doctor followed DirtMahn as the giant cookie began to follow. They left the building and ran to a nearby forest. They dug a hole and fell into a cave. DirtMan sealed the hole, put down some torches, and blocked off the rest of the cave. &quot;What just happened? Why did you take me here? What happened to Frank?&quot; Ishnarp asked DirtMan many questions. DirtMan started to explain, &quot;That potion had something in it. Something that caused the zombie, Frank, to transform into a giant living cookie known as 'Monster Cookie.' Something got into that potion that-&quot; DirtMan cut himself off. He remembers the little duplicates of Monster Cookie that he had escaped. &quot;The duplicates!&quot; He shouted in anger. &quot;They must have gotten into the mixture!&quot; &quot;Duplicates?&quot; Asked Ishnarp. DirtMan then proceeded to retell the previous events involving Monster Cookie to Ishnarp. At the end, his mouth hung in awe. &quot;So, my pet zombie has basically become the host of this 'Monster Cookie'?&quot; Asked Ishnarp. &quot;Pretty much.&quot; DirtMan replied. &quot;I think its safe to surface, now.&quot; DirtMan took all the torches and dug a hole to the surface, only to find a mob of miniature Monster Cookies awaiting him. The doctor stood next to DirtMan. &quot;I have an idea.&quot; DirtMan whispered to him. &quot;On the count of three, you give me every weapon you have. I'll hold them off while you go to the lab and try to get any lethal materials to destroy them. Deal?&quot; &quot;Deal.&quot; Ishnarp replied. &quot;Okay, one...&quot; DirtMan said, pulling out his diamond sword and getting ready. &quot;Two....&quot; He stood his ground, and dug his feet into the grass. &quot;THREE!&quot; The doctor dropped all his weapons, including some potions. He then ran back to the lab while DirtMan sliced and diced the Mini-Cookie Monsters. He started to notice their remains where piling up. After finishing the mob off, he noticed their remains all slip in a pile and morph into Monster Cookie bigger than three ghasts. DirtMan ran towards the lab. He got inside and heard a large thud. He felt the building shake and noticed the large crumbling hole in the wall and the hole in the floor where the door once stood.

The Monster Cookie had vanished. DirtMan still ran to the lab and looked for Ishnarp. He was standing over the cauldron. &quot;I think I found a way to reverse the effects of the potion! But it will take some time. But, wait, where is the Monst-&quot; Before Ishnarp could finish, the Cookie burst through the ceiling. Ishnarp grabbed the cauldron and ran out for the lab. &quot;GIVE ME FIVE MINUTES AND I'LL HAVE THE ANTIDOTE!&quot; yelled Ishnarp, obviously troubled and scared. DirtMan became angry, thinking of what the Monster cost him. &quot;You took my uncle's life, now its time I take yours!&quot; He jumped on top of the Cookie and stabbed its eye with the sword. The Monster then became very angry. It fell back. DirtMan jumped off him and ran over to a random cabinet. He grabbed a random potion, opened it up, and splashed it on the Cookie. It then grew limbs and became larger in size. DirtMan looked at the potion label,&quot;Enhancement/Evolution Serum.&quot; DirtMan hesitated, The monster stood back up. DirtMan pulled out a bow. He drew back the arrow. He shot the monster. No effect. He tried again. Still no effect. Then, as he was about to take his third shot, IshNarp stopped him. &quot;I finished the potion! Catch!&quot; He threw it to DirtMan. DirtMan caught it. He then coated the point of his arrow in it and shot the monster. It groaned and shrank to the size of a human. It changed back into Frank, who stood there for two seconds and then fainted. Ishnarp put him on the table he was on before turning into Monster Cookie. &quot;Well, looks like I'm going to have to repair the lab. Thank you for saving Frank and I, intern, but you're fired.&quot; Ishnarp said. &quot;I assumed as much.&quot; Said DirtMan. &quot;But about the building, I have an idea.&quot; &quot;What is it?&quot; Asked Ishnarp. &quot;It involves miniature cookies, wolves, and lots of Franks.&quot; DirtMan said with a slight grin. &quot;Oh my... I'll, err.... look into it.&quot; Ishnarp said nervously.

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;'''~ END ~'''&lt;/p&gt;

'''Alternate Ending'''

&quot;I finished the potion! Catch!&quot; He threw it to DirtMan. DirtMan didn't hear and turned at the wrong time. The potion hit him straight in the face. He yelled in pain. The Monster Cookie looked away from DirtMan and towards the source of the potion; The Doctor. It quickly ran over and grabbed Ishnarp. DirtMan looked up as the pain of the toxic potion wore off and saw the Cookie running off with Ishnarp in hand. DirtMan ran after his but started to notice where it was heading: the jungle. It ran over and DirtMan followed in a hot pursuit. It then went to the tallest tree in the jungle and climbed up it. It stood at the top. The tree was at least 120 blocks high. DirtMan began climbing the vines when he stopped and noticed a flock of chickens. He then had an idea.

Meanwhile, Ishnarp was trying to bite the Cookie's hand in an attempt to eat its way through like DirtMan did to escape it before, but it had no effect. The hand just kept regrowing. Then, out of nowhere, Ishnarp saw a cloud that made the sounds of a flock of chickens flying up to him. As it got closer, he figured it out. It ''was'' a flock of chickens. He was surprised to see DirtMan riding it. DirtMan then drew his bow and was about to shoot the monster, but then remembered how it hadn't affected him before. He decided to do the drastic thing. He threw a bunch of wheat at the Monster. The chickens quickly flew after it and ate it. They were now on the tree. The Monster roared at DirtMan. At that moment, he got another great idea. He pulled out more wheat and jumped into the monster. The chickens followed. Ishnarp didn't know what would happen to DirtMan, but he heard a shout from him inside the monster, &quot;ISHNARP, RUN!!!&quot; Ishnarp heard pecking, clucking, and many gulps. The Monster's hand then released him. Ishnarp fell to another tree and watched as chickens devoured him from the inside out. Ishnarp didn't see DirtMan. All he saw was the Monster Cookie dissolving as a white cloud slowly swept over it from the inside out. Ishnarp then called for DirtMan, but no response. He decided to head back to the lab. He jumped from tree to tree. When he got back to the lab, he had noticed he lost two friends today; Frank and DirtMan. He felt sad about it, but decided to wait a few days for DirtMan to return. He never did. So, under the very tree where DirtMan killed Monster Cookie, Ishnarp left a memorial to DirtMan.

A few days later, he returned and was shocked to find a note that said,&quot;Thanks, I always wanted a statue. Especially one that reminded me of a friend. -D.M.&quot;

==Strange Tales From Arsenic Village==
''It may help for you to read the page [[Rocket 93|Rocket_93.]]''

My name is Rocket_93. I am feared in some lands, and loved in others. I'm here to tell you of my time in &quot;Arsenic Village,&quot; as the strange locals called it. Let me start from the beginning. I was starving, hot, and tired . There was nothing but dirt for miles. I could feel the suns burning rays penetrating my sunburned dry skin. I needed water. And food. And sleep. The thing I thought about most was my family. My beautiful wife, Abigail, and my smart son, Connor. I missed them. I would see them soon enough, once I found the ranch. I then began to think of how great it would be to be in a snowy forest instead of a barren desert. Then, the village appeared. I was surprised. It was large, and it was snowing, too. Oddly enough, I looked around and there was snow everywhere, even though it was a desert. I ignored the random white blanket over the desert and went to a villager. This villager didn't look like villagers from other towns. It still had the Squidward nose, but it had a small head and longer arms that were separate instead of being folded. I noticed the traits were the same for the rest of the villagers here. I asked it where I was, and it said in a dull whisper,&quot;This is Arsenic, beware the creatures.&quot; I wondered what he meant, but ignored it. I asked if there were any houses I could stay in or any food I could have. &quot;We have an empty house that's free, and it has food, weapons, tools, water, and a lone wolf. You can have it if you like. Just don't go into the mineshaft.&quot; I accepted the offer and quickly put my things in the chest. What the man said was true, there WAS food, weapons, tools, and water. The only thing I couldn't find was the wolf. I decided to go around the village and look for him. I met some the villagers. After searching the whole village, I couldn't find him. I decided to go to the last house which was made of dead wood and obsidian. I knocked on the door. No answer. I knocked again, No answer. I knocked one last time. I heard the floorboards creak, and footsteps aplenty, but still no answer. I then opened the door. I saw a man, no taller than I was. He had the same shape as me. He dressed like in a suit. He was a human. I asked him various questions, like what he was doing in the village. His name is Jack Todd. He found this village once and decided to stay here. He is very anti-social and awkward. He acts odd, as if he's trying to keep something from me. I shook his hand, and was glad to befriend another human. I left his house and forgot all about the wolf. It was late and I finally got some rest.

The next day, I further looked around the village, but the dog was nowhere. I was bored but didn't want to leave yet. I decided to visit the man again. He was wearing the same suit he did yesterday. &quot;Do you ever take that suit off?&quot; I said, jokingly. He didn't seem to get it, and seemed a bit confused. He then asked if I knew how to make potions. I told him I was good, but not the best. He asked me if I knew who Herobrine was. I told him yes. He started asking me things like if I'd met him, and if I believed in curses and magic. I just responded no to the Herobrine questions and no to the curses and magic questions. He had a bit of an angry look on his face. I headed to the guest house and ate. I went to sleep. I had a dream that I was with the man in the suit. He was standing as he was. Herobrine walked up to us. While I drew my sword, the man stood there, waiting. When Herobrine came, he knocked me to the ground. I could barely see what happened, but it looked like Herobrine turned the man into some kind of creature. At that point, I woke up to a black furred dog shaking snow off and some of it landing on me. I sat up, wondering where it came from, then I got an idea. ''What if'' ''it came from the mineshaft? ''I thought to myself. I decided to explore it. That's where things went wrong. As I explored, found nothing but aggressive mobs, and the worst part is, I kept seeing this black thing swoop past me. Every time it went by me, the wolf started barking. I decided to leave, but just as I was about to, the man in the suit appeared. His suit was torn up and stained with blood, he had several cuts and scratches. I asked him why he was there, and he said that if he told me, I wouldn't believe him. I told him to test me, so he did just that.

He said that he worshiped Herobrine because Herobrine promised him great power. He, however, tricked the man into thinking the power would be something he could control, but the man found out the truth later. He found that the power was actually a transformation that make him a hideous yet powerful monster. He had to feed on things to survive, such as other people, or animals. The thing about the power was, the more he used it, the less he could control it. The wolf I had actually ended up becoming his friend, and would disappear for short amounts of time. Every time he came back, he told the suited man new methods to control his powers, but they only made it worse. He feared he would soon become this monster permanently. Then, when I came, he thought he could find some way for me to help. Possibly find a cure, or transfer the power, or something, but to no avail. He said all he can do now is worship Herobrine and beg he take the cursed power away, before its too late. I thought this whole thing was made up, so I laughed a bit, and said,&quot;You should be an author!&quot; He saw I didn't believe him, so he left.

The next morning, I woke up to find that the man was gone. His whole house was empty, and it was now made of the same materials as the other houses. I decided to look inside the house. I found a trapdoor. I went through it to find a dark hallway. At the very end was a nether portal. I went in and found a built Herobrine shrine. There was a sign by it that said &quot;None are forgiven, greed kills.&quot; I knew what the sign meant. I looked to the top of the shrine to find the black wolf. I called for it, but when it turned to me, its eyes were all white. Fire charges flew from the spot it was standing and it was engulfed in flames. Where was once a black wolf was now Herobrine himself. I silently ran back through the portal, went out through the trapdoor, and set fire to the house. The villagers stared at me, but none stopped me. After the house was gone, I went into the hole that the trapdoor lead to and entered. I went to the end of the hall and destroyed the nether portal. I then set down TNT throughout the hall and exited. I lead a redstone wire to the front of the guest house, put down a lever, and triggered it. No villagers were hurt in the explosion. And I stood my ground, not moving an inch. I went into the guest house, packed my bag, and departed. I walked out of the village. I was glad to leave, and according to my map, I was close to home. I turned back to look at the village, but it was gone. No houses. No villagers. Not even the TNT crater. The one thing I saw was the black dog, staring at me with all white eyes. It couldn't talk, of course, but I knew we were both thinking the same thing; ''We'll meet again.''

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;'''~ END ~'''&lt;/p&gt;

'''Alternate Ending'''

I thought this whole thing was made up, so I laughed a bit, and said,&quot;You should be an author!&quot; He saw I didn't believe him, so he left.

The next morning, I found the whole village empty. No villagers. Not even animals. I looked in the town well to find it drained out. I was a bit confused, but just looked around the town more. I went over to the man's house. I looked inside, and was horrified. There was blood everywhere. I went up the stairs and found something even worse. A large black creature that was too horrid for words lying dead. He wore the remains of what looked to be a suit. I looked up from the body to see the wolf. It stared at me, and then a message uttered in my head. &quot;''The curse must carry on.''&quot; I pondered this message for a few seconds before screaming when I noticed what was happening. My arms were turning completely black, and my limbs were too. I uttered a yelp of pain as my back seemed to bend in all the wrong places. I examined myself. I had become the monster I was just staring at on the floor, except now, in its place was the man in the suit.

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Prologue&lt;/p&gt;

Since my trip to Arsenic, things have been different. I am the creature now. I have utter power that others dream of. I can change my form into anything I want. I have found this as a gift rather than a curse. But, there is a consequence. My friends and family are convinced I'm dead. I cannot go near them, for I may scare them, or worse. However, I have new friends. The monsters. They speak to me. They comfort me. And my family is the moonlight. But if I ever come in contact with another being, I plan to pass on my gift to them. While I enjoy the gift, it has kept me alive through events I shouldn't live to see. I've had it hundreds, maybe thousands of years. I just hope I do not suffer the same fate as the black suited man. The one from that deranged settlement known as &quot;Arsenic Village.&quot;


==The Bride of DirtMan==
There was once a young lad named DirtMan. He was a friend to many, but he always felt something was missing. He would see others happy, and blushing. He had no idea why, though, and then, Dr. Bruno Van Stauffen came to the rescue. You see, Dr. Stauffen is a therapist and a scientist. He likes to find the problem AND solve it, but not always in the right way. So, poor DirtMan saw Stauffen's ad in the paper and decided to ask for his help. He walked in to see him already sitting in a chair. He pointed to a lounge chair next to him and said in his thick foreign accent,&quot;Sit.&quot; DirtMan proceeded to the chair and sat down. &quot;So, what is this problem of yours?&quot; Asked Dr. Stauffen. &quot;Well, ya see, I've been kind of bored lately, and I think it may have to do with me being...well, single.&quot; DirtMan blushed while saying this. Stauffen stared at him intently. He then started scratching his mustache and, observing DirtMan, he squinted his eyes. He then said &quot;Aha!&quot; and pulled out a remote from his pocket. He pressed a green button and DirtMan felt a small prick on from his backside. He jumped out of his seat and turned around to find a metal claw carrying a small bit of his dirt. &quot;What did you do?!?&quot; DirtMan yelled at Stauffen nervously. &quot;Don't worry, nothing lethal. I'm just going to run some tests on your dirt.&quot; Said Stauffen. DirtMan was horrified. &quot;W-what will you do then?&quot; He asked in horror. &quot;I'll find some way to make you happy.&quot; Stauffen replied, seemingly calm. While DirtMan was still horrified, this comment had somehow lightened the mood. &quot;Err...okay?&quot; He said to Stauffen. &quot;When are you going to see me again?&quot; Stauffen replied,&quot;I'll send someone or something to get you.&quot; To this, DirtMan got up and left.

A few weeks later, DirtMan was asleep in his dirt hut when he heard a knock on his door. He woke up and looked out the window. It was mid-morning. He rubbed his eyes and sat up in his bed. He walked to the door in his robe and slippers. He opened it to find a female Dirtperson (much like himself) in a bikini. &quot;Oh, are you DirtMa-&quot; she began to say before DirtMan shut the door. He ran up the stairs of his DirtHut. He immediately changed into his normal green speedo/underpants and immediately ran to the door again. He opened the door again to see the woman. &quot;Oh, hello. I was going to ask if you're DirtMa-&quot; She was again cut off when DirtMan yelled &quot;Yes!&quot; at her. He was so excited to finally have met someone. &quot;Well, since your DirtMan, I bring word from Dr. Stauffen. He says he used your dirt and implemented girl DNA to create me, your future bride.&quot; She said. DirtMan was almost jumping out of his dirt. He finally wouldn't be as bored or lonely. He hid his happiness and held the door open. &quot;Wanna come in?&quot; He asked. She nodded happily and walked right in. This was going to be a short week. DirtMan sat down and DirtWoman sat next to him. &quot;So, err, what are your interests?&quot; He asked her. &quot;Well, I was told that I like whatever you like.&quot; She replied. &quot;The doctor wanted me to become the perfect person for you.&quot; At this, DirtMan became very happy. He ended up just going throughout his daily routine. She did everything he did. From going out and harvesting crops on the dirt roof to slouching on the couch on the bottom floor. Soon, DirtMan and DirtWoman got to know each other better. DirtMan pulled a quick one and proposed to her with a red mushroom. &quot;Will you marry me?&quot; He asked her. She, of course, replied &quot;Yes!&quot; They were wed on a snowy day and were wed by DAVESDAVY.But DirtMan one night, things went horribly wrong. DirtMan decided to visit Dr. Stauffen and thank him for creating DirtWoman. He entered the lab and saw everything in a mess. The lights were even flickering. DirtMan found Dr. Stauffen knocked out and lying in the chair at his desk. DirtMan ran over to him and shook him awake. &quot;Doctor! What happened to you???&quot; DirtMan yelled at him. The Doctor came too and said,&quot;DIRTWOMAN! PLEASE, NO!&quot; He then looked around to see only DirtMan. &quot;Oh, good, just you.&quot; DirtMan then said,&quot;DirtWoman? How does she have to do with this?&quot; And the Doctor replied,&quot;Oh, um, yeah.... You see, when I cloned her using your dirt....I found some...err...side effects. They included severe mood swings, extreme obsession, and homicide.&quot; DirtMan couldn't help but stare in shock at the doctor. It was taking all his might not to smack him right across the face. &quot;I found that only one trait would take full power, and I thought it was the mood swings, but, no, its the obsession.&quot; The Doctor said. DirtMan let out a sigh of relief. At least she wasn't a psycho murderer. &quot;Well, I said it was the only one to take ''full ''power. The other two have taken effect.&quot; Said Stauffen. DirtMan then panicked and ran out of the lab. Stauffen yelled, &quot;WAIT! Before you go, I need to tell you how to stop h-&quot; But DirtMan was already through the doorway.

He dashed home. As soon as he burst through the door, a crooked voice came from the fence-post table where the torch once stood on a wall. &quot;Where have you been??? It better not have been with ANYONE ELSE.&quot; It said. DirtMan shook his head. &quot;No other woman, I just went to see Stauffen and tell him how well you were.&quot; &quot;You're lying!&quot; The crooked voice said. It stood up and walked into the light. It was a deformed version of DirtWoman. DirtMan quickly ran upstairs. The new DirtWoman followed him. He broke a glass block and jumped out the window. She was in the yard, waiting for him. She caught site of him. She pulled out a knife. DirtMan tried to run, but tripped and fell over. She came up and, odd as it may be, hugged him. DirtMan shoved her off. &quot;W-what are you doing??&quot; He asked her. She replied,&quot;I forgive you, as long as you don't do it again. EVER&quot; Her face went back to normal, up until she said never, at which point it was deformed again. DirtMan screamed and ran. DirtWoman chased after him with a knife in hand. DirtMan then knew what he had to do. He turned around and ran, right past her. He ran straight for the desert. He soon reached his destination, the lava pit. He turned around and caught DirtWoman. He knew what had to be done. He held her up, and threw her in. He stood there and watched her burn. It was the end of the Bride of DirtMan.

'''Alternate (Extended) Ending'''

It was the end of the Bride of DirtMan. He then realized, he was now the last Dirtperson alive. He felt sad, but just walked home. A few months later, DirtMan got a knock on the door. He was in his morning robe and opened teh door. He screamed to find a burnt and ashy DirtWoman staring at him. She just stared. She then said &quot;You'll pay for this, DirtMan. And, to let you know, Stauffen sends his deepest regards...from 6 feet underground.&quot; She then jumped on DirtMan and started choking him. Right before he was about to lose consciousness, DirtMan punched DirtWoman and got up. Before he could finish catching his breath, he ran upstairs and hid behind a note block. DirtWoman ran up the stairs. &quot;Where are you.... HONEY????&quot; She said, turning her head from side to side. She then walked up to the note block. She picked it up and moved it. &quot;THERE YOU A-&quot; She said, just be before falling flat on her face. DirtMan saw an arrow in the back of her head. DirtMan looked up, and to his relief, Stauffen and DAVESDAVY stood at the top of the stairway. Stauffen was holding a bow, while DAVESDAVY was holding a diamond sword, seeming to be guarding the stairway. &quot;But...how?&quot; Was all DirtMan could manage to ask or say. &quot;Well, DirtMan, its a long story. Well, not really. A few days ago in my lab, I was working on a concoction to help another patient when DirtWoman barged in, tied me up, and started to... do things. She cloned herself and knocked me out. When I woke up, I was laying in a bed in a small room with two torches. A sign on the wall said,'Die.' and I immediately remembered what happened. At that point, I searched my lab coat when I found a phone and thought of who to call. I then remembered the man who wed you two, 'DAVESDAVY' and I called him. He found that the room I was in was ''underground. ''Luckily, he tracked the cellphone signal and dug and mined me out of the room. I then told DAVESDAVY of what happened. We both then figured it out: she was going after you. So, we both headed to your DirtHut and found you, and that's how we're here.&quot; The doctor explained. DirtMan then asked,&quot;So there's more?&quot; &quot;Yes, and we need your help to find them.&quot; Said DAVESDAVY. They then set out and killed as many as they could, before returning to the lab and finding even more cloning themselves. They fought many, but then the doctor got an idea. &quot;I have an idea!&quot; He yelled to DAVESDAVY and DirtMan. &quot;What?&quot; asked DirtMan. &quot;I'll cover myself in dirt and lead them into some kind of trap that will end them permanently.&quot; Said Stauffen. &quot;What???? Stauffen, you'll get yourself killed!&quot; Said DAVESDAVY. &quot;Well, its worth a shot.&quot; Said Stauffen. &quot;Err..... I guess.&quot; Said DirtMan. Stauffen then ran to his desk and got a remote. He aimed it at DirtMan and shot some kind of laser beam. He then shot himself and a thick layer of dirt covered him. He then made a bunch of noise and attracted the DirtWomen. He ran as quick as he could and lead them off. After that day, he was never seen again, nor were the DirtWomen. Stauffen was soon forgot, but Notch knows where he disappeared to that day.


==The Circled Kind==
Jason, Carrey, and Jonah sat in a circle. They were waiting for their friend, Jackson, to come. They sat and soon Jason piped up. &quot;What if he's dead?&quot; He asked. &quot;He couldn't be dead, Jason, there's no way he'd died out of the blue.&quot; Said Carrey &quot;Yeah, he's just late.&quot; Jonah added on. They sat for 10 more minutes. Jason spoke again. &quot;I'm hungry.&quot; He said in a whiney voice. &quot;Fine, I'll go kill some pigs, Carrey'll set up the furnace and get out the coal, and you'll just......keep being Jason.&quot; Said Jonah. He then walked over to the door and was about to set out when a familiar face appeared. He opened the door to find Jackson staring back at him. &quot;Jackson!&quot; They all yelled in unison. Jackson showed no emotion and simply walked in. &quot;Hello, my friends. Lovely weather, yes?&quot; As Jackson said this, it thundered behind him and everyone else realized it was thunderstorming. &quot;Um...sure...&quot; Said Jason. &quot;Say, do you wanna sit down? You seem a bit ill.&quot; Asked Jonah. &quot;No, I assure you, my friends, I'm perfectly fine.&quot; Jackson said. All of the sudden, when Jonah put his hand on Jackson's shoulder, Jackson lashed out at him. &quot;DON'T TOUCH ME, YOU FILTHY LITTLE-&quot; He then held his hands up, and took a step back. &quot;I am truly sorry, humanoid 'Jonah'&quot; He said. Jonah was a bit creeped out. Jonah then went out the door to go hunt the pigs, and jason watched as Jackson took a seat. &quot;Jackson, you aren't yourself today, are you?&quot; asked Jason. Jackson slowly turned his head to him. &quot;What could you possibly mean by that?&quot; Asked Jackson. Thunder then struck outside and, for a second, Jason saw the outline of a circular being where Jackson once sat. Jackson was then there again, and Jason was a bit nervous. He turned around and walked away. &quot;Well, I finally got the furnace working, after breaking and re-placing it many times.&quot; Said Carrey. Jonah then burst in the door. &quot;PIGMEN! EVERYWHERE!&quot; He yelled. he closed the door. &quot;Did you get pork?&quot; Asked Carrey. &quot;Yeah, I think this'll be enough.&quot; He said. He then dropped 3 stacks of 64 pork. He looked over to Jackson, who was staring eerily back at him. He walked over to him. Without thinking, he punched him on the shoulder. His hands flew right through and his arm fizzled as if it were a T.V. screen. Jonah took a step back. He was in shock. &quot;Who-who are you?&quot; He said to 'Jackson,' who then replied,&quot;I'm Jackson. Who else could I be?&quot; Jonah tried to touch him, but this time, he felt Jackson. He walked over to Carrey. &quot;That's not Jackson. It couldn't be.&quot; At that point, Jason piped in. &quot;Of course it isn't. When the thunder struck, I saw some oddly shaped figure sitting where he was.&quot; They all looked at each other and noticed complete silence. They slowly turned around to see Jackson staring at all of them. &quot;Its not nice to gossip.&quot; He said as his whole appearance started to fizzle and pixelate, just like Jonah had seen before. He slowly inched towards them when Jason ran to a room and shut the door. He blocked it off with obsidian, and Jonah and Carrey heard a chest open. They then looked back to Jackson and he grabbed Jonah's neck. He lifted him up by it and threw him across the room. &quot;You should have just ignored the signs.&quot; Said Jackson. He turned to Carrey. He stepped in her direction. &quot;I would let you live, but you've seen to much.&quot; He reached his hand into his pocket and pulled out an odd kind of gun. He then aimed it at Carrey when Jason lunged at him. He put the sword through his head, but it didn't seem to affect him. At this point, his whole appearance fizzled and pixelated again. It then completely changed into a short figure made of completely circles. Carrey looked at it in shock. Jason pulled his sword out of where the fake head had just been. He then noticed the monster-like creature had 3 eyes. It blinekd and stared at him. It then screamed. &quot;Oh no, Mothership shalln't like this! I must inform them before its too late. It quickly ran out the front door. Jason watched it as it ran about ten feet from their hosue before yelling,&quot;YOU SHALL ALL BURN WITH YOUR PLANET!&quot; Lightning then struck it down. After that, they all sat down and discussed what just happened and kept armor at hand just in case anything were to happen. Nothing happened, but they will never forget the day they encountered what each of them agreed to be an extraterrestrial.

'''Alternate (Extended) Ending'''

After the small circular man had been struck down by lightning, they all sat down. The lightning cleared up and they all had some pork from the pigs. It had become day, and they were all very tired. But their adventure wasn't over, yet. As they all sat around and talked, a rather loud sound had gatehred around their house. ALso, when they looked out the window, the noticed that there was a shadow cast over them, as if something were above them. They all decided to go outside. They looked up to see a giant oval-ish shape hovering just above their roof. Its underside glowed until it shot out some kind of beam in the very middle. This beam started disassembling the house. Soon, some turrets came out of the sides and shot at trees and animals, starting fires and setting off explosions. At this point, when the trio tought it couldn't get any worse, more circular figures appeared and jumped off the hovering saucer-like machine. They attacked them and others headed off. Screams and explosions were heard in the distance. Carrey looked in horror as all the machines turrets aimed at them. Jason narrowly dodged their shots and Jonah had gotten blown away. Carrey was in bits, her armor, weapons, and inventory scattered all around. Jonah and Jason ran. They were going to have to look for others to help them. Jason looked back just in time to see the last of house disappear. His only thoughts were &quot;And the war begins.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1632">'''The Second Minecraftian War''' began almost instantly after the First, just a matter of years following the defeat of the Templar Order. The Second Minecraftian War was largely based around the oppression, censorship, excessive worship of prophets and political leaders, and the whereabouts of the mysterious [[The Vox Populi|Vox Populi]], an underground militaristic group that, some speculate, could be attempting to spark a Minecraftian Revolution.
==The Battle of Minascus==
It is said that the Battle of Minascus officially sparked the War. The event quickly followed the official emergence of the Vox Populi, attempting to charge through the gates of Minascus and reclaim the city from their former captors. The battle resulted in the liberation of Minascus by the Vox Populi, and the attention of many Minecraftian factions.
==The Battle of the Diamond Sphere==
Months after the victory of the Vox at Minascus, the group had gained much support and equipment for war. It is around this time the Vox Populi first started wearing Creeper heads. Seeking materials, the Vox attempted to excavate the massive Diamond sphere constructed by Caesar's Legion in the warring land of Los Reyes. The Vox were able to excavate a very partial amount of the diamonds before the 7th Cavalry of the United Legion retaliated with great force, armed with longbows and loaded blunderbusses. The battle lasted several hours, however in the end the 7th Cavalry had driven the Vox Populi away from the Diamond temple. Unfortunately for them, however, the Vox did not walk away empty handed - They now had a sufficient supply of diamonds for war.</text>

Lewis and Simon were about to witness the horrors of the night unprotected until they built a small, dark shack in a forest by a tree. After doing research on their series, they created some sort of cave called the Yogcave. It was a very fine build I agree, but something horrible happened in one of their episodes. They were building a tower above the Yogcave when a pale-faced creeper man with red eyes attacked from above. It was a mystery they never knew about. After some more construction of the tower, they noticed a structure in the ice, an igloo! They decided to check it out, they later then discover it was that sneaky little Israphel. They then noticed a little pyramid in the distance and then traveled to it. Didn't end up unharmed after the visit, they were badly burned of much lava burning them. It was a little on of Israphel's games, but they finally completed it with burns and scars to find nothing of value in the prize chests but some crap, but they took it anyway.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="679">The '''Songbird''' is essentially a smaller but much faster and much stronger version of the Ender Dragon. Standing at 40 feet tall and 30 feet long wings, the Songbird is a force to be reckoned with. He offers assistance to any powerful being who can master his call.

To summon and have the Songbird assist you in battle, you must have a note block and a Songbird statue (crafted with 6 leather, two glass, and one iron ingot) handy. Place the note block on a dirt block and repeat this process three times:

1-2-3-4 1-2-3-4 (quickly) 1-2-3-4 (1 second apart) x3

Then you right click the ground with the statue to summon the Songbird.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2835">A long time ago there lived two brothers. One was named [[Herobrine|Brine]] and the other was [[Markus Persson|Markuss]]. People called him Notch though often. One day, Notch was mining some wood (Oak) on an Oak tree. He picked some ripe red apples and bit into one. &quot;This one's good.&quot; Notch said out loud. Brine on the other hand, was fetching clean straw to bake bread. &quot;I hate fetching the straw. Why can't I do easier jobs like Markuss?&quot; Brine grumbled silently. The two were very different also. Notch had reddish-brownish hair but Brine had dark brown hair that got in his eyes. Notch had much lighter skin too. Peach while Brine had a tan. Brine was walking home until he found a dark cave. He ran toward it and a smile crept along with his kind face. His blue-purple eyes were shining in wonder as he took one step inside. Then another. Then a third step! All of a sudden he heard a moan. He quickly turned around but saw nothing but air.&quot;Just the wind.&quot; though Brine unaware. He shifted closer to a shining light. Notch was following him to Brine's surprise. &quot;Don't move any closer brother!&quot; Notch shouted. But Brine didn't want his brother Markuss stealing all the fame he was going to get. &quot;Whatever!!&quot; Brine yelled back, snappish. Notch was taken aback and shifted backwards. Brine saw a purple gem that was HUGE! It was very shiny and sparkly. He touched it for a second. Big mistake. &quot;Noooooo!&quot; Notch shouted. An explosion was happening all of a sudden as purple gasses filled the cave. There was Brine nowhere. Notch grimly walked home sadly. Brine was gone. Forever. Notch went back to the cave and surprised, found Brine huddled in a corner. &quot;Markuss......&quot; Brine growled sternly. Notch backed up at the sound of his voice. It sounded ghostly with a sharp growl and snappish feeling. &quot;You didn't..... save me. WHY!?&quot; Brine shouted in his face. &quot;But I DID try to save you. Didn't you see me? I even cried for days thinking about you!&quot; Notch replied. Brine hushed him and said he still didn't SAVE him. No matter how many times Notch said he tried, Brine declined the apology. &quot;I shall stalk everybody in this world. Because then, they'll hate your game that you were gonna make! MInecraft!&quot; Brine snapped with an angry tweak in his voice. So, there on, you may see Brine. Turns out, ppl started calling him Herobrine. After all, he WAS once a hero. But that wasn't the reason sadly. People hated him and though he was a myth. Some see him with their own eyes. And some had never seen him but think he's real. But Herobrine is actually lonely. So lonely. &quot;Everybody runs away from me. That stupid gem. I turned into a monster!&quot; He always grumbled in his cave. But he was still mad at Notch. Just remember, that if you see Herobrine...... run. Stay if you feel bad because he's lonely....... The END.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12683">[[File:Woodkid - Iron||right|335 px]]
It was the first of May in the small village in Angmar...

The sun was sinking deep in the late spring sky. Its red and orange hues streaked the heavens with a strange and eerie light that made the darkness of the woods shadowed and frightening. A creep of green moss covered the trunks of the trees, and old wet leaves covered the paths. It was not a night I wanted to walk alone, but I had no choice.

''Dung heap cheater! ''The words pounded my head. ''I cannot believe that I took you at your word.'' The breath of the forest whispered along my neck. The night air was growing, growing cooler as the sun set, but I stayed warm like a blanket. ''Go get it, Tavish, ''he said, ''Can ye no' see that I'm busy, you scoundrel?''

My name was not Tavish. That was the name my father gave me. And he's not even my real father. I always dreamed about my biological father, his bright blue eyes and welcome smile that mother told me about, before she died. I hoped that, someday, if I had the pleasure of meeting him, he would accept me.

My stomach twisted at the memory of my brother's tone and words. ''Busy, aye! Busy making eyes at Bridie MacDonald, ''I thought, laughing at the thought.

I was running home, hoping to make it in time for supper. I had been exploring a cave system and even found some iron, however it was of no use and I had not learned how to handle a pickaxe yet.  I had always been more of a runner. I could run faster than the wolves could, and at times I never needed a horse. Sometimes my adoptive father calls me the last son, even though I was the oldest of all my &quot;siblings&quot; and he wasn't even my real father. It was getting dark and I was nearing my home. But what I found when I got there was not what I expected.


==An Uninvited Guest==
The village was a ghost town. I found no one there, not even the town crier. All the furnaces still running, some doors open. I stepped into my small cobblestone home to find not  a single soul there. However, my senses went from calm to terrify in the next five seconds. &quot;You there. Young man?&quot; said a voice from outside. I heard a horse's steps getting louder gradually. &quot;I know you're in there, lad. I can see you.&quot; Louder. I peeked out the window to see a giant black horse right outside the door, a buff man with battle scars all over his face. But there was one detail that was unmistakable and captured me completely.

Emblazoned on the man's chest was the brilliant symbol of the Templars, the red cross seeming to light up the area. Filled with amazement, I ran outside the door. I could now see that there was a knight mounted on a horse before me, shining chain mail armor below a Templar cloak. The knight stepped off his horse. &quot;Would ye happen to be Tavish?&quot; The knight asked. His voice was calm and comforting, but I felt there was still more to the man that meets the eye.

&quot;Yeh-Josef, Sir Knight,&quot; I muttered,  preferring my real name. The knight stepped closer. &quot;Aye, ye are the one they speak of. Pleased to meet thy, Josef Furnace. I am Sir Pitcairn. I am your master.&quot;

I had always dreamed of riding with the Templars. Seeing the brilliant strongholds, venturing to the Nether, and spreading Notch's word. But those were just dreams. I hardly even knew what was going on now.

&quot;P-pardon, sir? My master?&quot; I managed to say. &quot;Indeed, lad. Or at least that's what they told me. Come. I'll explain on the way.&quot; The knight responded. He motioned for me to get up on his horse. I did so, and we immediately set off. &quot;Ye said we shall discuss on the ride.&quot; It slipped out.

&quot;We shall need to do something about that accent of yours. Anyway, I meant not this ride. Your ride hasn't even begun. You will know when it does.&quot; The knight smiled. For what seemed like hours we trotted through the woods, and perhaps passed by one or two fellow Templar camps. But soon something much more amazing came into view.  We finally came out of the forest into the plains, and I could clearly see dozens of snowy mountains, towering above us. Each mountain was topped with a brilliant Quartz tower, lighting up the night sky. But on the tallest mountain was a huge &quot;manor&quot; that looked more like a fortress. Vigilant guards stopped us and eventually let us through the gates. I had entered Myecelia, home of the Templars.
==Mycelia==
We rode up the mountain on a cleared dirt path, the road getting bumpy at times. We passed by a cave and I could just barely see lava pouring out in the bottom. I shivered. Finally we reached the bridge to the main fortress. It was unlike anything I had seen before. The bridge was made of smooth Nether brick and cool stone bricks, and I hesitated to dismount the horse and begin crossing. The braziers on each side of the bridge were unnerving, a constant fear of burning to death shooting through my veins. I held my breath and followed Pitcairn across the bridge, promising to not look down. The walk was shorter than I expected, and soon I had neared the iron bar entrance to the main fortress. Pitcairn motioned for me to step inside. I did so, and I felt a warm felling rush through me. I felt home here. Even though my real parents were gone, I could feel them here. I belonged here. I looked to the back of the room and saw two knights sparring with wooden swords. They moved swiftly and gracefully, and for a moment it looked like they were dancing together. ''That would be me someday, ''I thought.



&quot;If you truly are what they say, then yes, it is possible.&quot; Pitcairn said. Had I mumbled? &quot;You mumble more than you know, son.&quot; He said again. I followed him through the brilliant fortress. The blue and red carpet on quartz felt welcoming, though it may have been cold. We reached a grand staircase and began walking up. It could have taken hours to reach the top. By the time we reached the top floor, I was winded, however Pitcairn looked full of energy. He continued walking along the white carpet, only occasionally looking behind him to see if I was still following. At the end of the hall was what could have been a throne room. I could smell garlic, spaghetti and of course cooked steak and porkchops. I immediately perked up and rushed to get inside. The two guards in front of the door fingered their blades, but stood out of the way when Pitcairn came into their site. He pushed open the birch door and I almost fell to my knees. I hadn't expected what I saw.



I entered the throne-like room, made of sparkling gold and quartz. I was lost in the sight before me. And the smells, yes, the smells ofr cooked porkchop and spaghetti. I looked to the side of the room and saw a long table that looked like it belonged to a king. It was full of food, from bread to meat, and I was glad to see faces put to the stories. &quot;Finally Pitcairn. I began to think you would not come.&quot; The voice said from the front of the room. What must have been the holy Grandmaster of the Templar Order stood near me, dressed like a medieval nobleman. His attention was turned to me. &quot;Is this.. him?&quot; The Grandmaster asked Pitcairn. &quot;I believe so, my lord.&quot; He responded. What exactly was I doing here, anyway? I still had so many questions.



&quot;I am sorry our friend here could not reveal much,&quot; the Grandmaster said, &quot;but I shall answer your questions now.&quot; &quot;The Pope of Minecraftia himself says that he has received a message from our Lord Notch,&quot; he started. There was silence for a moment. &quot;You are the prophesised hero of Minecraftia. You will bring glory to the Templars and to our Lord. But should you fail, the rest of us shall fail as well. I hope you understand the seriousness of which you are involved in.&quot; I was dazed. ''Me? The hero?'' What had I gotten myself into? &quot;Josef Furnace... you must become a Knight Templar. You will be trained by Sir Pitcairn. And we hope that in time you will become one of us.&quot; The Grandmaster spat out. I had no time to react. Pitcairn  escorted me out and we headed back down and into the barracks. I grabbed the most suitable equipment for my size. And, immediately, my training began.


==A Templar's Birth==
10 years later...

After a decade of intense training, praying, and enduring various Templar trials, I was ready to become a knight. I specialised in the art of the Assassin, and I could leap from building to building, tree to tree with ease. I walked nervously with my cloak and mail armor on towards the center of Mycelia. I ceremony was being arranged for my knighting. A much older Pitcairn escorted me to the center, where the Grandmaster waited, sword in hand. I shook off all the nervousness and bravely walked towards him, leaving my master behind. I was anxious to become a Templar. Soon my dream would become reality. I kneeled before the Grandmaster. He spoke loudly to the crowd.

&quot;I belive it is time we welcome Josef Furnace into our fold. He has proven himself worthy since the day he came to us. He should be able to share in our knowledge and strength. Are any opposed?&quot;

The crowed was almost proudly silent.

&quot;Very well,&quot; the Grandmaster continued, &quot;Josef, stand.&quot; I stood tall before the Grandmaster.

&quot;Do you swear to uphold the principles of our order and all that which we stand?&quot;

&quot;I do.&quot;

&quot;And never to share our secrets nor divulge the true nature of our work?&quot;

&quot;I do.&quot;

&quot;And to do so from now until death-whatever the cost?&quot;

I took a deep breath. &quot;I do,&quot; I said proudly, letting it out.

&quot;Then we welcome you into our fold, brother. Together we will usher in a New Dawn, a New World.&quot;

Every knight stood at the signal.

The Grandmaster slid a golden ring with lapis lazuli markings on it onto my finger.

&quot;You are a Templar. May the Father of Understanding Guide us.&quot; The crowd echoed.

'''''May the Father of Understanding Guide us!'''''

And in an instant, I become one of them. I was a brother to all who stood before me, and I was ready to serve Notch. But first, there was one thing I had promised myself I would do.

My real parents were out there somewhere. I could feel it.

They weren't close. It would take a long journey. But I was ready. I would follow my heart to find them, and I knew where to start.

==The Father of Understanding Guides Me==
I packed what I needed for the journey. A Redstone hidden blade, a porkchop, an emerald to buy more food, and my light Templar cloak. I left without announcement that night and made my way down the hill to the town of New Elgin. There, I bought a compass and made a hasty retreat north. I walked along the icy shores and finally reached the plains of the Bluedog Frontier. I had begun my journey.



I traveled at night and rested at day to avoid bandits. Within three days I had run low on food and had entered what is called Sherwood Forest. In the dark of the night I heard a loud voice.

&quot;Halt! State your buiness!&quot; The voice said in perfect Mycelian. &quot;I am Sir Furnace of the Templars. My camp is but three leagues from here. I am returning from a routine scouting. Who are you?&quot; I asked.

There was little noise, but I could hear hushed whispers. I counted at least five voices.

&quot;It matters not who I am. There is no camp here. We would have seen it. I think you are alone.&quot; He replied. One silhouette appeared less faint, and I could make out a figure with tattered clothes and a dagger. Two more figures appeared behind him. Arms grabbed me from behind, shouting in my ears. &quot;Sir Thomas! Sir Basil! Help! Bandits!&quot; I shouted, hoping to scare them off. I had began to ran out of hope.



&quot;Get your slimy hands off the lad, rats! Or would you like to test the accuracy of an Olexian Republic Archer?&quot; A voice from behind shouted. A Republic Archer? Here in the woods?&quot;

An arrow wizzed by my head, striking one man in the back.

&quot;Heed my warning and leave this place, or my next arrow finds a throat and not an arse!&quot; The archer yelled.

What appeared to be the leader of the group turned to me. &quot;Very well, Furnace of the Templars. I will see you again.&quot; And with that, the bandits ran off into the darkness of the forest.

I turned to the archer, getting a better look. &quot;I am Sable Melano, former Republic Archer. I quit serving their arses two years ago. Been searching for trouble for two years now,&quot; Sable said, chuckling.



&quot;If it's trouble you're looking for, how would you like to accompany me on my quest?&quot;

&quot;I thought you were reporting back to your camp.&quot;

I smirked.

&quot;Ah, I see now. So what are you really up to?&quot; Sable asked.

&quot;Well, it's quite a long story actually... I'm... sort of looking for my parents. I was seperated from them when I was wee. My heart tells me they are within the Bluedog Frontier.&quot;

To be continued.

They oppose the worship of prophets, political leaders, and the limiting of freedom of speech exhibited in many modern Minecraftian factions. The Vox are easily recognized by their inevitable symbol, a Creeper Head, also worn by soldiers of the faction to intimidate enemies.

==The History of the Yogcave==
The Yogcave was originally a natural cave in the base of a large mountain, containing small coal deposits which broke through the stone. After surviving the night in a shack, the bearded dwarf Honeydew and the spaceman Xephos decided they needed a permanent home. Honeydew leads a hunt for coal, in which they stumbled upon the small cave. They decided it provided excellent natural defenses, and set to work building their new home.

After much work, floors and walls were erected. Soon after, in the middle of the night, a peculiar tree grew a few feet from the doorway. Honeydew made quick use of it, calling himself a born lumberjack.

Xephos soon decided on building a tower above, and creating a &quot;Yogcastle,&quot; to which the Yogcave would be situated below. His work was long and hard.

Days later, whilst returning from hunting, Xephos found Honeydew struggling to &quot;put on the heating.&quot; This was the first test of endurance for the Yogcave, in which the floor caught fire, and a shaft under the floorboards was found. In a partial flood, Xephos quenched the fire. As Honeydew opened the back door to let out smoke and steam, he tripped over a pressure plate, which ignited a load of TNT beneath. Honeydew was killed, but Notch rebirthed him, as he does any other true Minecraftian who perishes, a short distance away. As Honeydew trudged back to the Yogcave.It took him a minecraft day so he had to fight his way there at night.

After their strange experience, Honeydew decided to delve into the Earth, and begin a mine. They returned days later with goodies, only to find a masked jester making changes to the world around them. They begin construction on a portal to the Nether a short distance away. Xephos returns to the Yogcave to empty his satchel, whilst Honeydew takes a snooze outside the portal. When Xephos returns, fire, mossy cobblestone, and mushrooms had sprouted nearby. Upon returning to the Yogcave, their stalker had mischievously opened the door, and left a note about it. Later that night, whilst deciding on what to do with the roofless Yogscastle, a man named Israphel climbed to the peak and began to fire arrows. Honeydew angrily screamed &quot;OI!&quot; as they retreated. They quickly constructed a barrier, just in time for Israphel to come through the entrance to the Yogcave. The adventurers chased him off, but were left startled.

The duo continued to improve their home, and Xephos constructed a stairwell to the Yogcastle. As they began planning for the castle, Israphel once again attacks. Honeydew once again attempts to make contact, but Israphel flees. They pursue him down a tunnel, Honeydew uses his Dwarven rage to cut through the stone like butter. They come out onto a path, with Israphel missing. As they followed the path on to a new adventure, Israphel's cult attacked.

[[File:YogcaveRuined.png|thumb|left|314px|Ruins of the Yogcave.]]After returning from an island on which they were trapped, Honeydew and Xephos, along with two new companions, Old_Peculier and Skylord_Lysander, found the Yogcave, or ruins of. As they emerged from the tunnel which connected it to the Nether portal, Honeydew cried out at the sight. Night soon fell, and Skylord_Lysander informed them that they must go to [[Mistral City]]. So, the two adventurers abandoned their home, never to visit it again.

They both almost camited suiside , but they were so sad they didn't even.

It is midday, as 3 players wander the woods. The players are Feather38, Cowhead and Wood plaks, 3 moderators who have been sent by Hill city server admin Jace Coal to find player Nixton Nax, a player who disappeared 2 minecraft weeks ago. &quot;We've been searching for 2 days now&quot; says Feather38 &quot;Lets just turn back&quot;. &quot;No&quot;, Cowhead protests, &quot;He's our friend, you know. He should be somewhere&quot;.

While Feather38 and Cowhead were talking, Wood plaks was searching further and found the wreckage of a house. &quot;Feather, Cowhead, you better get down here&quot;, Wood called. Feather38 and Cowhead appeared. &quot;Lets search the place&quot;, Cowhead suggets. After a few minutes of searching, Cowhead called, &quot;Feather, Wood, I've found a book&quot;. Feather38 and Wood Plaks appeared. &quot;What book is it?&quot;, asks Wood. The 3 then proceeded to read it.

==It was cold, dark, damp.Not a sign of light for miles.No cows, sheep, anything of the sort.He turned his head to the left.He was there.The sword in his hand, sharp as a blade of grass and fully crafted out of diamond came plunging down on him.It was only a matter of time.He was weak.The blade sunk its way through the depths of his body and came back out as if it were coming out of water.==
Steve came out of his house to get to the breakfast gathering.The villagers greeted Steve with their usual &quot;hrrrrm&quot; and they walked with Steve all the way to the gathering hall.The king of Minecraft, Notch, stood at the great behind him and called out his morning welcome,&quot;great morning everyone!we have some news to tell you all before we start the breakfast feast!&quot;he continued.&quot;We have signs of Herobrine being dead!!&quot;The crowed gasped and murmered at this comment.&quot;we have Steve to thank for this great deed he provided us!&quot;Steve looked astonished.He wasn't the one responsible for killing Herobrine.&quot;But I wasn't the one to kill Herobrine! You made a mistake!&quot;The king replied in a mumble,&quot;of course you killed him&quot;.Steve just stood there in anger.The number one thing that he hated most was being told he did something when he didn't do it, even if it made him a hero.The crowd cheered at his fake victory.Steve thought that maybe he was set up, framed in a way that might kill him eventually,&quot;Maybe Herobrine set it up,&quot;He thought.He could see the trap in it.Herobrine has wanted Steve dead for a very long time.When Steve thought about it, he could see Herobrines plans come together.He was usually really smart though, how could his plans be so visible?Steve was thinking that his plan was to fake his death so that he could come back again and the villagers would think that Steve is still the hero and make him fight Herobrine to his death.Steve didn't want to die.He wanted to make his life long and full of adventures, but because of this, his life is at a high risk.

After the breakfast gathering, Steve ran back to his home to continue building his farm.His family had owned that farm since Stevius Cube the first existed.The farm has been expanding and expanding over the past three hundered years.Farming was Steves favorite hobby.He ran inside his home and pulled out Pumpkins, Melons, and Wheat seeds out of his giant farming chest.Then he yanked his hoe off of the nightstand next to his bed.He darted outside and block after block he hoed, hoed until no untouched dirt was visible as far as his eyes could see.Then came the seeds.He ran through the fields again, planting each seed at a time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4627">Ch-1 : The Prophecy

&quot;Jack! Wash the plates, now!&quot;

Jack, that's ME. Y'see, I used to be rich and all. But somebody trolled me and I was left alone to work for that rude monster, Clara. She treated me like as if I was her dog. I hate her, I swear I hate her by the skylands. I used to have a good life. It's just- It's just- Bah! Nothing. Now I am siting in Clara's kitchen washing plates. Suddenly the doorbell rang. &quot;Who's it?&quot; Clara asked. A voice mumbled through the door. Clara froze. She glanced at the door. She took her kitchen knife and tiptoed along the floor. She opened the door slowly. &quot;Mmmf! Help!&quot; an old man screamed. Clara stared in horror to see a robber with a black ninja mask. &quot;Ms.Clara. Give me all your diamonds and I will leave this man&quot; the thief ordered.&quot;Who is this man to me anyway?&quot; Clara replied . Suddenly I stood up, with confidence and said &quot;He's my friend&quot;. &quot;Jack,&quot; Clara said. she glared at me. I frowned back and continued &quot;He is my friend. Leave him alone&quot;. The thief's eyes were filled with confusion. he looked at me and then back to Clara. &quot;Did you hear what I told you?&quot; I asked. The robber, somehow left the old man alone, and fled. &quot;How--- How'd you----&quot;. Before She could finish, I stared at Clara and took the hands of the old man and left. &quot; I will never come back&quot; I told her, and we left. We roamed the Town Square until finally the old man said &quot; Thanks. I can repay you in anyway you want. Do you want Gold?&quot;. I pushed down my cooling specs and raised an eyebrow. &quot; Or maybe I can tell you about the prophecy?&quot; he requested. Suddenly, I stood. &quot;I am listening&quot; I said. Then he started: 

&quot;In a day's time shall a man come, escaping from the chains of slavery

and he must break the walls of chaos.

He must restore peace that hasn't been restored

and must end the reign of the ender king forever&quot;

&quot;So, who is this man?&quot; I asked. Suddenly he glanced at me. He scanned me as if I have hidden some gold or something. Then he said,&quot;You--- Yes, YOU are the one.&quot; I froze. I looked at him. He just seemed to nod with a wide smile. I raised an eyebrow and mouthed the word WHAT! Then my surprise turned into a wide grin. &quot;I am a hero&quot;

Ch 2: Getting armor

We walked alongside Crafton apartments and headed  towards Creeper Lane. Creeper Lane was having a dull time. The people there were just staring into space, like they were looking for some constellation. The old man lowered his head down. &quot;This place is just like my village&quot; the old guy said. &quot;Wait, you live in a VILLAGE?!&quot; I asked. Surprisingly, he nodded. &quot;So you have a family there?&quot; I asked again. He looked at me and said &quot;My wife died in a battle and my daughter, well, she got captured by the ender men&quot;. Ender men, I thought. Why is the End involved in this? I just left the thought and continued. Suddenly, The sun was almost to set. &quot;It's sunset. We must build some sort of shelter&quot; I said. The old man turned towards the direction of the beach. &quot; We can build a house out of sand&quot; he said. &quot;Good idea. But it will go down, right?&quot; I doubted. &quot;I'm good at sand crafting, young man&quot; he said and took out a stone pickaxe. He mined some blocks of sand and built a small house with it. &quot;There we go&quot; he said. I smiled and we got inside. He closed the house by building one more sand block. &quot;So, what's your name?&quot; I asked the old man.   &quot;You can call me TheElderScribe, or, Prometheus&quot; he replied. &quot; I'll call you the first name. Whereas my name is Jack&quot;. We shared a lot of things about our life. &quot; Jack, I wanted to give you some diamonds and some sticks, so that you could make some armor&quot; he said. &quot;That's kind of you sir&quot;. He gave me and I crafted a diamond sword and a diamond armor. I stared at it for seconds. &quot;My old life is back&quot; I muttered. &quot;You can try this out tomorrow or some other time&quot; he said. We then slept in the darkness.

Ch 3: A dream

I suddenly landed on the woods. I looked around to see if there wereany other people. Then I saw Ender men wandering through the woods. I hid behind a tree. Suddenly a man appeared in front of me. &quot;Hello, Jack. You've come at last&quot;. I scanned him. His head had no normal eyes. His eyes were cloudish. His body was filled with green grasses and flowers. A fancy shirt, I thought. His hair was totally white. He had legs that reminded me of a lava waterfall. &quot;I know you are thinking about your birth place, son&quot;. I looked at his shoulder and saw and enderman coming right THROUGH him. I moved aside making way for the Enderman. &quot;Jack, You know me. May be you forgot about me&quot;. &quot;I forgot---&quot; I started when he suddenly said &quot;I am your father, Minecraftia&quot;.</text>

==The day of the crash==

CLINKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!

&quot;Mayday, Mayday, Ship Malfunction!&quot;

BOOOOMMMMMM!

==Day 1==

I don't remember how I got this broken rib.
I don't remember how I got this deep gash on my forehead

I don't remember how I got any of my wounds, all I remember is my name.

My name is Dray. Dr. Dray, to be exact.

I felt numb, my body, ached all over, and I could remember nothing.

Finally, I managed to pull myself up and walk around, I was in a forest. I began to use a knife to break a few blocks of wood, I then sliced them into planks, four to be exact. I then used the knife and fashioned four of the planks into a workbench.

How did I know how to do this? I didn't remember anything, and yet I know how to make this item, and I know what it is.

I used the workbench to fashion some of the planks into sticks, then those and some planks into an axe, a sword, and pick, and shovel. Again, how do I know what these an items are and how to make them?

I began to gather more wood, and make them into wooden planks, when I realized that the sun was setting. I kept working though, but began to feel tired, and very hungry. I found some sheep and killed them, then used the wool and some planks to make a bed, and killed some cows and pigs, I got five pork seven steaks, and four leather, ill figure out what to do with the leather tomorrow. I set my bed down near my table, ate some raw pork and steak, and fell asleep.

I woke up to the pain of an arrow piercing my flesh, and spent the rest of the
night trying to survive.

==Day 2==

The monsters where endless.
They just seemed to keep coming.

After three or four monsters, my wooden sword broke.

I punched and punched endlessly, my nuckles seemed to crack with each blow.

Finally the sun came up, and many of the monsters burst into flames, And some just stopped attacking. But others seem ineffected.

There where many types, green ones, that resembles rotting versions of me, Zombies? White, one that resmbled a human skeletal system, Skelotons? The other eight legged, short ones seem like giant archnids called spiders. And finally, some tall, four legged, green beasts. I have no idea what they are called, but they seem to explode when they come close to me.

I was half dead when the assault ended, I pulled my self up, It felt just like the first day all over agian.

There was no chance of finding my bed and other items agian, but I still had some wood and tools with me, so killed a pig, and ate the pork raw.

After eating and resting some more, I decided to get some wood to make a shelter for the night. I also decided to make some armor out of the cow leather I got yesterday, so I made a new crafting table, and made some boots, and some armor pants.

after harvesting more wood, and mining enough stone to make a small hut, I started looking for a place to build my home, when I saw a gaping hole in the ground.

I built my home near the hole. I killed some sheep for wool, and then, finally, I made a bed and went to sleep to the cozy sound of monsters growling and maoning.

==Day 3==

The night was uneventful. No monster attacks. No explosions. Just sleep.
I felt great when I woke up, and was ready for the day; I decide to explore the cave. Then I realized something, since monsters came out at night, shouldn’t they come out in a dark cave? I wondered how I was going to make a light source, when I remembered about torches, they could create light, but I would need coal or charcoal.

I took my first few steps into the cave, and saw some stone with black dots all over it. I used my pickaxe and got about 13 pieces of coal, I took them back to my home, and used my work bench to create some torches out of the sticks and coal.

I got my sword ready; I was ready for the day.

I didn’t very far when I found some stone covered in pink dots; I used my pick to mine it, and founded about 14 after I finished exploring the cave.

I quickly ran back to my home, and somehow I knew to smith the ore into iron. I used my workbench to create a furnace out of eight cobblestone, and I used some coal I had founded in the caves to smith the iron.

After that, I made an iron sword, pick, and some new boots and a helmet, then I fell asleep for the night.



Suddenly, something exploded, my bed was destroyed, and I was hurt badly. I was forced to use my new iron sword to defend my damaged home, monsters poured in, I fought and fought and fought, and almost died.

==Day 4==

Today was the worst day yet.
I was sure I had never felt so horrible in my life.

My stomach growled loudly, so I pulled the last piece of pork out of my chest. I was about to stuff it in my mouth, raw, when I decided to try something new.

There was still a little coal in my furnace, so I threw the pork in there and waited patiently as it cooked. Finally the pork turned a red color; I grabbed it and wolfed it down. I healed so fast, I barely noticed it, unlike eating raw pork, which took forever.

My iron sword was bent badly, and I knew it couldn’t take much more, so I decided to go get some more iron, and coal.

When I stepped into the cave, I knew something was wrong, all my torches where gone. I got excited and scared at the same time. This meant that there was other intelligent life here besides me. This also meant that someone could be waiting to ambush and kill me.

I mined some iron and coal, and ran back to my house as fast as I could; I knew that I didn’t have much time. When I got back, everything seemed just as serene and peaceful as before; but I wasn’t sure. I ran into my house. Laying there was a small book. I opened the book to a random page, and read:

Day 234

Today is just as desolate as all the other days, the same routine, the same things over and over.

I feel like jumping into a lava lake.



I now know there is someone else here with me, and I would have to find them. But not now, because the sun just touched the horizon.

And so I made a new bed, and tried to sleep. Finally, after a few hours, I fell into a restless sleep, fitful sleep.

==Day 5==

I woke up.
Everything was black.

Not night black, pitch black.

I accidently rolled of the bed, and felt my face. There was something soft and furry sticking to my face. I pried it off and held it into the light so I could see what it was. It was a cat. The cat meowed happily at me, and I set it on the ground. It just stood there, looking at me.

“What do you want?” I said to it. My voice sounded rustic and foreign, as if it weren’t my own.

It just meowed at me, and laid down on my bed.

“Fine” I said. “Have it your way, I’m leaving for a while.”

And so, I left.

I went to explore, looking for more signs of other people, I found none. I looked, and searched, and found almost nothing, but then I found a small house, I walked in, I found a sign and carved into it with a rock, you’re not alone, there is a house just over the mountains, come there if you want to see me.

And I left. I went home feeling satisfied. I walked into my cave and went very deep, I mined lots of iron and coal, at one point I even found some gold ore.

Maybe I should mine some diamonds, I thought to myself. Whatever those are

And so, I went back to my house, just as the sun was setting, and I went to sleep, with my cat, I liked the cat, it was good not to be alone.

That must be the house the sign was talking about, I will camp by it tonight, and wait tell the person awakes.

==Day 6==

I woke up, and popped my head out the door.
I saw a small tent out on the right side of my house. I jumped over to it excitedly, and dug through it. I found some tools and supplies, but nobody was in the tent. Then I saw a small trail of blood leading into the forest, so I grabbed some weapons, food, and tools, And I ran into the forest.

When I finally got there, I followed the trail of blood to a tree. The trail of blood went up the tree, and into the leaves, where a young women, about my age was laying. I couldent tell if she was sleeping, unconscious, or dead. I climbed nto the tree, and picked her up, I carried her all the way back to my home, and put her on my bed. I didn't know what to do at first, but then I realized I should get some water and give her a drink. after I did this, I got some food ready for her incase she were to wake up.

The sun went down, and I realized how exhausted I was, I knew I couldent stay awake all night. I pulled some blankets all over me, I stayed awake a few hours, wondering what tommarow would bring. Then I slept.

==Day 7==

My ears had grown very sensitive over the last week, and even the slightest sound would wake me up. I heard feet shuffling quietly on the wood floor. I jerked myself up, and grabbed my sword voilently. It was just the women. She was awake and looking around, but she was having a hard time seeing.
&quot;Here&quot; I siad. &quot;Let me help you.

She jumped at the sound of my voice. &quot;Who are you?&quot; she asked

&quot;My name is Dray, Dr. Dray.&quot;

&quot;My name is Mellina.&quot;

I took my flint and steel and lit up some torches. I could see that she had light blue eyes, brown hair, and bronze-tan skin.

I quickly looked out the windows, the sun was rising fast.

&quot;Are you hungry?&quot; I asked.&quot;

Yes, I would love something to eat. What do you have?&quot; She replied.

&quot; I have a few apples, and three peices of cooked pork.&quot;

I quickly handed her an apple, and a slice of pork.

&quot;Thanks, Im starving.&quot; She siad

She devoured the food in minutes, and I pulled out my pik, my axe, my sword, and a stack of torches.&quot;I`m going out to get some resources, the cat is somewhere else in here, and there`s food in the chest if you get hungry.&quot;

I opened the door and shut it, and ran out. A creeper walked up to me. It was wounded badly already, so I killed it. It dropped a small pile of gray, powdery substance. Gunpowder. My mind seem to say.

I cut down some trees, explored the cave, and found some iron. But while I was coming back saw some shiny blue dots on the ceiling of the cave. I made a staircase up to the ceiling, and I mined the blue dots. A blue jem droped out when the block broke. I wasn't shure what it was.

I poked my head out of the cave, The sun ws almost gone, so I ran back home. I opened the door, and locked it. Mellina was sleeping. I quickly put the torches out, stored my stuff in my chest, and went to sleep.

==Day 8==

I had a dream that night. Notch was talking to me.

&quot;Hello Dray, you have a great destiny, you and mellina must destroy the great evil in the end, if you don`t then everything in this world will be destroyed, Then your world will be next.&quot; He siad.

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I siad &quot;How do I get to the end?&quot;

&quot;You know, now goodbye Dray, And stop the evil!&quot;

After I woke up, I told mellina about the dream, and Notch talking to me.

&quot;Wow! Notch taled to you? You must be really important!&quot; She exclaimed

&quot;Thats what he told me. But anyways, I found some blue shiny gems in the mines, do you know what they are?&quot; I asked.

&quot;Those are diamonds! How many did you find?&quot; She asked me excitedly.

&quot;7 in one vien.&quot; I replied.

&quot;Thats enough for a pik, a sword, and a Enchanting table!&quot; She exclaimed.

She grabbed some iron, some sticks and the diamonds, and went to work smashing them into things.

She handed me a diamond pik, a diamond sword, and a bucket. She put an iron sword, an iron pik, and an iron bucket in here pack.

&quot;Lets get some water, so we can turn the lava into obsidian, then you can mine it with your pik.&quot; She siad

&quot;'What do we want obsidian?&quot; I asked.

&quot;For a nether portal, and a enchantment table, You go get the obsidian, ill make the book.&quot; She siad, and ran off.

I grabbed myself some water with the bucket. I ran down into the mines, and grabbed some poured the water all over the first lava pit. Then I took 10 minutes to mine about twenty obsidian.

I came back up, and gave most of thee obsidian to mwlissa, who began to use it to make the portal, then I pounded the obsidian, diamonds, and the book into an enchantment table.

By the time we where finished, it was dark, and we where tired, so we went to bed.

==Day 9==
When we woke up. There was a strange looking zombie hanging around the nether portal.
&quot;Whats that?&quot; I asked Mellina

&quot;It looks like a pig, and a zombie! Its a zombie pigman!&quot; She replied.

&quot;Holy crap, its got a sword, lets kill it!&quot; I yelled, and ran over with a sword, I quickly killed it. It dropped three small gold objexts, and a gold sword.

We quickly suited up in some iron armor, and got some supplys, tools, and weapons.

&quot;Ready to explore the nether?&quot; I aksed right before we jumped into the portal.

&quot;Yup, I`m so excited to possibly die.&quot; She replied.

We jumped into the portal. When we reappeared, we where in a strange place, the ground was made of some strange red stone, and some of the occasonial brownish sand.

&quot;The nether is wierd.&quot; I stated.

Suddenly a weird noise sounded, and a huge fireball flew at us. It flew right over our heads, and exploded on a wall behind us. Then a huge squid like creature appeared in the distance, and it shot another fireball at us.

&quot;Run!&quot; I yelled, and we ran away, when we saw a large structure made of a strange type of brick. On our way there, we found more of those zombie pigmen, and almost fell in a few lava lakes and oceans.

We got up on the structure and began exporing it. We found some strange red bumpy items, which we decided to call nether wart. It only grows in that weird sand.

We saw a strange kind of balcony, and it had something on it.

&quot;Whats that?&quot; I asked, but my question was answered as some human sized, yellow flying monsters that shoot fireballs came out of it. We decided to call it a &quot;monster spawner&quot;.

&quot;Lets kill them!&quot; I siad.

&quot;Indeed.&quot; Mellina replied.

We killed 30 of them, and got about 20 orange rods from them. We traveled back to the portal, and got back home. When we came to back to the normal world, it was night.

&quot;Lets figure out what to do with this stuff later, right now, lets get some sleep.&quot; I siad, while yawning.

We took of our armor, and threw our items into the chest, and fell asleep.

==Day 10==
When we woke up, I smelled the wonderful smell of rotten flesh and bones burning in the summer sun, I also smelled some pork, bread, and eggs cooking. I turned around to see Mellina cooking breakfast.
“Smells good.” I Stated. “What you cooking?”

“Just some omelets, and some ham, which is made of pork. Its almost done.” She said cheerfully

“Thanks! I`m starving, and I mean literally.” I exclaimed.

She sat down two plates of food, one for me, and one for her, we both sat down, and started eating.

“Do you think we`ll find anymore survivors?” I asked

“Maybe, but you haven`t been here for very long, and you’re the only person I`ve met in about two or three years.” She said simply.

We didn’t say much after that, but when we had finished, we got up, and I said “Let’s get to work.”

We started by making a brewing stand by bounding a blaze rod a three pieces of cobble together, and then we smashed the rest blaze rods into powder.

We then spent all night killing the tall black things for the green pearls, we got about thirty.

“Why are we getting these?” Mellina sked. “They are useless.”

“I know what to do with them!” I argued

I went to work making small cracks into the pearls, and pouring the powder from the rods into them, the cracks would then reseale themselves, and the pearl would turn into an eye like thing.

After we did this, we had a small meal, and a conversation about what we where going to do tomorrow, then we went to sleep.

==Tobuscus==
[[File:TOBUSCUS!!.jpg|right|150px]]So far, he's created over 400 episodes of Minecraft gameplay on his TobyGames channel. The first 31 videos are labelled &quot;Part #&quot; while all videos afterwards are simply just tilted.

When he first started playing on Minecraft, he had absolutely no knowledge of the pixilated world, but over time he has learned via experience and reading up online.

Many players use mods including Toby, who uses his mods for special items and new dimensions.

As of 5/5/2013 Tobuscus has stop playing Minecraft after that day, making many Minecraft fans requesting if Toby can play the game again.

==Appearance==

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;His appearance is based of himself. The only difference is that instead of the whole word  on his T-Shirt, he instead has a T written shirt which the T stands for Tobuscus (which is his nickname)&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1155">'''Tyxyx''' is a player whose story is very complicated.

==Storyline==
Tyxyx was orphaned as a kid. He was raised buy some kind villagers in a  plains biome. There he met a young fellow player, Qazws. They quickly learned to fight and by the time they turned ten, were defending their village from attackers. But, one fateful day, an attack from a neighboring village destroyed their village. They were the only survivors. As Tyxyx looked at the burning rubble that was once his home, he vowed that he would get revenge on the village that destroyed almost everything that mattered to him. He bid farewell to Qazws and left everything he knew behind him.

On the first night Tyxyx got into an encounter with a skeleton. He attempted to defend himself but an arrow hit his left eye, blinding that eye. He lost the fight, ending up nearly dying. [[File:Tyxyx.jpg|thumb|Tyxyx (artist-[[user:0spore13|0spore13]]]]

Later, he returned to the placed where his village once stood and in its place, a temple devoted entirely to Skydoesminecraft in its place. Enraged, he vowed to destroy the place and all it stood for.

==Origin==
Undead Willows are a forest on the server, &quot;OlexCraft.&quot; It is currently inhabited by AwesomeA321 and is near the Darkagora and HappyNewYears' houses. Undead Willows were said to have once been the location of a town. The residents of this town were a mix between endermen, villagers, and Steve. 3 years after the town had settled, a witch appeared. She was disguised as an old woman. She asked one of the residents for meat and drink, and they turned her down. Angered by the man's selfishness, she cursed the town. Soon after she left, trees started growing around the village, as if to surround it. The villagers were starting to worry. Then, trees started to grow within the town. They grew within every crack and crevice. The whole town was soon devoured by wildlife, and as for the villagers, they were never seen again. Now, dead roam where the town once stood, and the legend of the forest is known all across the land.
==Pictures==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1987">Vecton156 is a creeper hunter who hunts creepers for a price and for the thrill of it.

== Becoming a creeper hunter ==
Vecton was once a miner with a dog called Gray as his only friend. Then one day, while mining, 5 creepers attempted to kill Vecton. Gray attacked the creepers to defend Vecton, the 5 creepers blew up and Gray was tragically killed in the explosion while Vecton was horribly scarred. Vecton then continued to keep Gray's bones in Gray's memory. He continues to hunt creepers , Gray's death fueling his grudge against creepers. His main enemy is the creeper king, as the creeper king sent the creepers that killed Gray

== Gray's death avenged ==
Vecton153, 15 years after Gray's death, Vecton was contracted to kill the creeper king. Tracking the creeper king to his castle, Vecton stormed the caste and killed all of his creeper guards. Vecton then reaches the creeper king's chamber and confronts the creeper king. The creeper king then charged at Vecton and a the two engaged in a sword fight. At first, they clash swords, then the creeper king disarmed Vecton and knocked him to the ground. Undettered, Vecton leapt up, grabbed his sword and then impaled the creeper king through the face. As the creeper was about to self-destruct, Vecton was fortunately able to leap out of a window just before the creeper king exploded.

== Personality ==
Before Gray's death, Vecton was an active and happy guy, and cared for Gray deeply. After Gray's death, Vecton became a grim, anti social person and held a deep vendetta against creepers ever since Gray was killed.

== Weapons and abilities ==
Vecton is a skilled runner, being able to outrun any player and is very athletic. He is also a skilled fighter and can use a sword with ease. Vecton is also very athletic and acrobatic, being able to actrobatically dodge anything

Vecton's main weapons are a bow with fire aspect II for long range and a diamond sword for close combat.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1310">'''Windforth '''is a town under construction on the Minedlands server. It was founded by Captain_Naughty, who later invited Cannonwalker to join him in the town.
==History==
Captain_Naughty and Cannonwalker both started their Minedlands careers as citizens of [[The Island (Minedlands)|an island]], which Cannonwalker was the founder of. After some time had passed, Naughty and Cannonwalker were both becoming discontent with life on the island. The two decided that they would leave and start societies of their own: Cannonwalker went on to start [[The Brotherhood of the Golden Pants]], while Naughty went on to start what was an unnamed town themed after the Nordic countries.&lt;gallery type=&quot;slideshow&quot;&gt;

2014-06-14_22.23.45.png|Windforth as it currently stands
&lt;/gallery&gt;

After construction had begun on both of their different societies Naughty invited Cannonwalker to join his, while Cannonwalker invited Naughty to join his own. Naughty had told Cannonwalker that he was unsure of what to name the town; he was debating between Windforth and another name. Cannonwalker liked the name Windforth, and so the town officially adopted the name.
==Citizens==
*[[Jeremiah Garland|Captain_Naughty]] (Founder; Leader)
*[[Cannonwalker]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1224">Once upon a time, there lived two wolves. One was named Harry and the other was Larry. They romped around every day and scuttled through the grass. &quot;Hey Harry!&quot; Larry barked loudly. &quot; A person is coming!&quot; Harry wax taken aback and tried to do a cute expression. It was a person named Steve who had brown hair, blue-purple eyes, a turquoise T-Shirt, and jeans. &quot;Here you go cute little fellow!&quot; Steve said sweetly. &quot; You too little guy.&quot; Larry and Harry were tamed and followed Steve back to his house. It had a comfy feeling and a nice entrance. Surrounding Steve's house was a giant village surrounded by a 90 foot stone wall. But then a terrible day struck. As Larry went out to fight with Steve, a Creeper decided to come by. &quot;Sssssss!&quot; A sound went. Larry turned around and try to sprint away but it was too late. The Creeper exploded sending Larry off his paws. &quot;No!&quot; Steve shouted. He sliced the Creeper's head off and rushed over to where Larry had been thrown. Larry gave a whine and Steve carried him home. Harry was terrified and worried at the same time. He thought Larry would be ok but the next day, Larry died. Harry knew something now. He lost a great friend. AND LARRY WAS GONE. Forever.

'''Zump1''' is a semi-noobish Minecraft player who, although having spent nearly three years on Minecraft, likes nothing more than surrounding himself in TNT and blowing it up. He is a long-time resident of the [http://minecraftmuseum.net/forum/index.php Cubic Worlds] server and [http://www.minecraftpvp.com/ctf/ Minecraft Capture The Flag]. A survivalist at heart, Zump's builds are mostly simple wooden structures containing a bed, chest and torch. While in possession of several incredibly confusing mines, he prefers being above ground, hunting Zombies or searching for his next meal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2966">Hello wikians! This is my first newsletter, I apologized if it's too short or it's too uninteresting. 

The wiki was born in 2012, however, there wasn't a lot of activity, nearly all of the administrator has either vanished or quit Wikia entirely. Since the whole administration has disappeared that just leaves me to handle the wiki. My goals for this wiki is to get a total of ''at least'' 20 active editors, and have at least another 4 more administrators when we reach enough active editors. There will be '''a lot''' more changes coming in the near future, some will be great, some will change the rules, and some will help you out. 

My main objective at the moment is to create a friendly environment so everyone can have a good time, and not to worry about anything except for keeping up with their stories. Some users have known me on another wiki that does have a bad reputation with drama, I'm here to tell you, that there will be no such thing here. I've been thinking the past few days how to remove drama entirely. So far, there has been various changes to our [[Rules]] here. 

One of the rule changes is about community votes, it is not up to an administration to decide who gets promoted with special user rights. Instead of using this method, I'm using a different approach. This approach abolishes community votes on whether who get's promoted/demoted/banned or not. I've created pages on [[Rollback]] and [[Administrators]] '''(I know they're dead links at the moment, don't create them just yet!)''', where the user (if he/she meets the requirements) can apply for special user rights. The Administration will then huddle up in private chat to decide whether or not that user can be promoted. Then the administration will pick one of themselves as the bearer of either good or bad news.

Are you afraid that one administrator will get corrupted? No, you shouldn't be worried on whether or not an administrator is corrupted. They're main purpose is to help this wiki grow so their decisions will ''always'' have to be beneficial to the wiki. An administrator is chosen by the following: determination, wisdom, dedication, and their activity. 

The wiki does have a a lot of inactive admins, doesn't it?

Yes, the wiki does have a lot of inactive administrators. I will try to get in contact with them (Please do not contact them, remember this is an administration job not a user job!). If they don't respond in 2 weeks, they will be demoted, if they don't edit at least 35 edits after their response (for at least a week), then they will be demoted. Administrators have lives too, so if they have vacation or something turned for the worse than they will be excused. It is the administrator to tell the other administrator that he/she will be going to take time off from the wiki.


There you have it. All my plans, dreams, and how this wiki will try to avoid drama. 

Happy editing! I'm looking forward to read all your creativity :) &lt;3&lt;3 xoxox</text>

&lt;small&gt;Hate scrolling through the Rules? Here's the full page of rules [http://mcplayers.wikia.com/wiki/Minecraft_Players_Wiki:McPlayers_Wiki:Rules here].&lt;/small&gt;
==What to do==
#All edits should be made in Good Faith.
#You must gain your editing rank on the leaderboard. If you are caught doing edits that are being done over and over again, you will get a strike.
#Three strikes means you get a ban, this ban's length will depend on what you have done.
#You may only add images that are your own. Screenshots are welcome but don't add copyrighted images. (Any image owned by a big company or group, like a picture of character, made-up place, or a design, will be removed and you will get a strike.)
#The Administration has great experience, please do not disrespect their decisions. If you do, you will earn a 1 day ban.
#If you are not a registered user, please do not complain about a ban, doing so will result in that ban being lengthened.
#Have fun editing!
==What not to do==
#Pick fights with other users just to get attention, this will get you a warning.
#Make categories without administrative permission.
#Edit pages in short length, or add non-existing or false categories to a page. Earn achievements fairly, just like everyone else (Doing this will get you a four day ban).
#Posting an inappropriate picture of yourself will result in an automatic ban, no strikes. The length of the ban will be decided on the severity of this picture.
#Cussing, Swearing, Cursing, or any other Inappropriate language. This will get you a 3 day ban, no strikes. You've been warned.
#Grudges
#Fighting your ban, as a registered or an unregistered user will get the ban lengthened.
#Inappropriate language, words, thoughts, or behavior! You will receive NO strikes or warnings, but get a 3 day or longer ban, depending on the severity of your language, words, thoughts, or behavior.
#Disrespecting other users.
#Become obsessed with wiki politics. Only editing here to get special user rights.
==Becoming an Rollback, Chat Moderator, or Administrator==
#A user may not instantly become an admin, it depends on many things.
#You may apply to be an rollback on the [[McPlayers Wiki:Rollback]].
#You may apply to be an administrator on the [[McPlayers Wiki:Administrator]]
#Only administrators may vote on promotions to bureaucrat.
#Bureaucrats will require a private administrative vote (in which they may not participate, but are allowed to make a statement in) in which at least 2/3 of the administrators agree to the demotion to be discharged of their duties as bureaucrats. Separate votes are needed for the removal of admin and rollbacks powers.



*&lt;small&gt;Rules can be changed by the administration.&lt;/small&gt;
