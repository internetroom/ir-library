      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6302">The +Z Highway digging crew is a group formed around late 2016/early 2017. The group started because of the influence of the trend of completing the major Axis highways, created by the [[+X Digging Group|+X highway group]] in late 2016. Many players set out to complete the highway and began to help gRiNdLoRd, DC91, and BobRock who took out to dig the [[+Z Axis Highway|+Z highway]] in the summer of 2016. The group has currently reached the border on June 9th, 2017.

== History ==
This was a Reddit post by gRiNdLoRd who posted the entire history of the +Z highway expedition:

&quot;Due to the recent interest in nether highways I thought I would share what I know about the +Z highway. I started playing on 2b2t June 4th 2016, and the first thing I did after getting out of spawn was to collect supplies to go to 1 million. The closest highway to me at the time was +Z so that's the direction I headed. This was before the new queue system had been implemented so there were constant server restarts and the queue was sometimes over 800. 

After getting to the 1 million overworld marker I camped out for a week and using a pig farm and carrot farm I stocked up on supplies and continued to head further out (here is what it looked like before and after it was greifed ). I eventually found a quad spawner (3 spiders and a zombie) and settled down to gear up and building something.  Around July/Aug a player by the name of DC91 (previously DarrylC91) found my build randomly (while I happened to be logged in) and we started talking. He told me that he had been playing on 2b2t since 2014, and at that time the +Z highway had been dug to just over 1 million overworld (about 145k nether). He and another player by the name of BobRock had started to dig the highway further and by the summer 2016 they had gotten it to just past 3 million. 

About a month or two later DC91 decided to quit 2b2t because he said it had become broken due to the influx of new players and I haven't seen him on since.  With as much as I was using the highway, I wanted to pitch in and help improve it. So I decided I was going to expand the highway from 1x2 to 2x3 for horse travel. During the months of Sept/Oct I dug out the highway from 125k all the way to 350k using only the 12-15 mending/eff5 picks I had made. I would dig the highway, /kill to get back home, and then use my gold farm to repair the picks. After that project I decided to make a few hundred blocks of iron highway since I had built 12 iron farms. Eventually with the help of a few others, I dug the highway out to 2x3 from spawn all the way out past 350k nether. Keep in mind that this was before the [[11/11 Dupe|Nov dupe]] so all of my tools and gear were made from scratch. 

But back to BobRock who had continued to dig the [[+Z Axis Highway|+Z highway]]. I would check in on him randomly to hear about progress. It was around this time that I started talking to a player named Nations and invited him to come to my base. I told him about BobRock and how I was going to head out to help with the highway digging. Nations would eventually take an alt out to the end of the highway to help BobRock dig further. BobRock and Nations over the next few months were responsible for digging most of the nether highway from around 3 or 4 million all the way out to 14 or 15 million (which is around the time that [[Byrnsy]] finished his [[+X Digging Group|+X world border journey]]). 

A few other players came out to join the +Z team (dotsoa, NickHasCancer, Sunwukon, and Gsmack) I want to give full credit to BobRock and Nations as they have dug most of what is now considered to be the +Z nether highway. Also, BobRock is responsible for all of the million markers that can be seen along the way  and Nations is responsible for all of the rest stop builds along the way. My favorite is at 14 million where he re-created spawn with lavacasts and withers. I apologize if I've left anyone out.&quot;

=== Completion ===
This was a reddit post by Gsmack upon the completion of the highway: 

&quot;Finally the Z+ highway has been completed. Around a little over a month ago I headed down the Z+ highway because I always wondered how far it went. I had never heard much about it so I headed down. I also figured It would be a great contribution to 2b2t to go down the highway and come back with it stretching all the way to border. So I went to my stash and grabbed 6 shulkers of pickaxes, pearls, totems etc and headed on my way. I traveled for a few days of overall time when I finally made it to 16 million overworld. There I met Nations who was working on the 16 million milestone. He gave me 4 shulkers full of even more pickaxes and said he would catch up. Apparently he had more stuff than he would ever need so he also gave me 3 shulkers of pig spawners and some stacked armor. So I headed farther down the highway. It wasn't until 22 million when I finally caught up with dotsoa. He was building the 22 million milestone when I got there. I took a look around and then went on my way. 

I dug to 23 million then finally we were at 24. 3 million nether. We stopped to build a base for a couple weeks, I built a gold farm and fixed my 2 shulkers of picks I was down then went to go dig the final stretch. I dug from 3 million to 3.5 million in a matter of a few days. Everyone was catching up and other diggers dug for a little. I flew ahead to build the 29 million monument because I knew no one would want to stop, too eager for border. It wasn't until last night June 9th, 2017 that me and NapkinTheBatDad finally finished the dig. Some of the other diggers were Netnei, kekkekkek1, Sun_wukon, NickHasCancer, gRiNdLoRd, Nations, BobRock, and Pyroyetti420. Sorry if I did miss anyone but I'm not positive on who mainly did the first 250k nether. Here are all the screenshots I collected along my journey plus some of my netherrack mining stats.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3942">'''The Negative X Highway, '''is a [[highway]] constructed on the negative X axis, heading west, and is one of the four central highways. It starts in the nether at (0,0) meeting the other highways. Since December 2017 it goes all the way to the world border. While it is 2x3 at the beginning this drops down to a simple 1x2 tunnel at around -210k.

== Geography ==
The highway used to be one of the lesser developed of the overworld highways on 2b2t, with large sections of it just being a single strip of path block or cobblestone. There are very few builds on this road, the only one of significance being [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbP0tQISZg The -10k Castle] which was heavily griefed sometime in late 2016/early 2017. The road also had a large farm area around -12k which was also destroyed some time in early 2017. It also had a smaller farm area at -100k before it was griefed in April 2018.
[[File:2017-06-15 13.04.52.png|thumb|220x220px|A large floating swastika above the highway at -27,570]]

== -X Team Private ==
-X Team Private was (and still is) a group founded by Metrez and Bramblery. After hearing that no one has dug the -x highway in a while, they decided to take action. Although the highway was heavily filled with traps, bad infrastructure and so on, Metrez managed to get a few people to help maintain the highway until the then-current digsite, -850k. After succesfully performing this project he decided that he wanted to dig all the way to the world border. Metrez asked Bramblery to help him with the discord server and organization. After they succesfully set things up, they decided that, in order to get invited to the private discord, you have to be at least -850000m from spawn in the nether on the -x axis. Everything went well and as planned, BobbyButronic, RonIsBest, ShRules, mrx123 and more people helped the founders to dig to the border.

On November 13, 2017, the dig started.

At around 19 million, a known member of the -x team got killed while AFK. Because he had set a pearl before going afk, he decided to go back to his stash, get all the resources he needed, made someone load his pearl and went back to 19 million, and since the highway was extended to -20 million at the time he arrived at 19 million, he went to 20 million, started recording a video and went AFK.

Then, 1 hour into the video, a member of the -x team popped up on the footage (Not named due to being too irrelevant) and killed the AFKing member. He got caught and said that he did it for the lol's and that he was planning to grief more monuments + that he had set traps everywhere already. The -X Team then decided to have a small pause at 20 million to fix all the monuments.
After succesfully doing so, the digging continued.

We decided to stop at -374000 and do &quot;final 10,000 dig&quot;. Because obviously not everyone could be online at the same time due to timezones, Metrez made a strawpoll and the final dig was decided to be held at December 22, 2017. A video of this made by Nekramite can be seen [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MGUYXZMWyI here], and a video made by Bramblery can be seen [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXH_Qnlx4qk&amp; here].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1531">{{Stub}}The '''Negative Z Highway '''is a [[highway]] constructed on the negative Z axis, heading north, and is one of the four central highways. It starts around 50-100 blocks north of [[spawn]] and is estimated to be 2 million blocks long. The highway has a quite high standard, being two blocks wide and including side-barriers and staircases going on and off, until it drops down to a narrow bad maintained pathway after circa 20,000 blocks. As of June 2017, the overworld highway ends around 570,000 blocks. It is currently being extended periodically by a player by the name of Swervin777. 

On August 7th 2017 gRiNdLoRd successfully flew under the nether floor from spawn out to -3.75 million. He was able to get back above the bedrock, build a nether portal and reach the -Z world border before the -Z highway was completed. Two days later there was a plug-in installed on the server to prevent players from flying under the nether floor. He still has an account there and continues to build while waiting for the -Z highway team to finish digging the highway.

|}Helios Squadron is a group founded by {DATA REDACTED BY AUTHOR} to provide a safe place to build and store items in there vault such as books, maps and other rare items.

Helios Squadron have branched out to intelligence having members in high profile groups such as {DATA EXPUNGED}
=== '''&lt;u&gt;Bases&lt;/u&gt;''' ===
Helios Squadrons old main base is called '''&lt;u&gt;Fortuna&lt;/u&gt;''' named after the greek godess of luck and has 12 of the main group basing there. '''''&lt;u&gt;Destroyed 07/01/2018 due to coordinates being found and used as leverage.&lt;/u&gt;'''''

Helios Squadrons new main base is called Tyche named after the greek goddess of good luck and fortune and houses all the original 12 members of Fortuna and is built with an extensive dupe stash at its core '''&lt;u&gt;''Founded 07/01/2018 due to main base Fortuna being destroyed''&lt;/u&gt;'''

Helios Squadrons spawn base is called &lt;u&gt;'''Ares'''&lt;/u&gt; named after the greek god of war and it is used as a quick gear and storage place that gets emptied once a month due to it being with in 250k of spawn.

Helios Squadrons trial bases are called &lt;u&gt;'''Hades'''&lt;/u&gt; (H1 - H7) which is named after the greek god of the underworld and is used as a base to trial new member on trust and loyalty. this base does not have a physical location and is a name reference to several sites over the map counted as one due to the short term nature of trial bases. '''&lt;u&gt;''Founded 07/01/2018 due to main base Fortuna being destroyed''&lt;/u&gt;'''

Helios Squadrons vault base is called Zeus named after the greek god of the sky due to it being a floating island and the base being home to many higher ranked members *Major or higher* it has been taken care of with many hard to get items and maps. '''&lt;u&gt;''Founded 16/01/2018 as part of the base cell plan of 2018''&lt;/u&gt;'''
==='''&lt;u&gt;Projects&lt;/u&gt;'''===
Project HSBM is a sand [[Duplication Glitches|duping]] machine combined with a creeper farm used to make tnt and still working to this day it abuses the tps on the server and a quirk of the server side code making it impossible to patch and makes 2 shulkers of tnt every 2 and a half hours.

Project HSNA is a perpetual motion tnt machine that is meant to simulate a nuclear armageddon and has worked in testing along side HSBM.

Project HSEP is a enderporter made out of redstone and it is the first recorded use of a mechanism like this making it so setting a pearl inifishant.

Project ZD is a zombie dupe that was used after the donkey and lama dupe it was founded by a user BlacklistedName and it goes like this you equip a zombie that can hold items with a shulker then you push it though the end or nether portal and make it take damage on the same tick as pushed though then on the other side it should of duped the items you equipped it with

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="989">0xymoron is a player on 2b2t. He is a well known merchant of artifacts and is a small 2b2t youtuber.

== History ==
0xymoron's early history is unknown.

0xymoron has recently revealed the coordinates of the 4th Reich's base in which caused the 4th Reich to retaliate and destroy one of his museums.

== Role on 2b2t ==
0xymoron is a lover of 2b2t history, as he has made many museums at several bases and has one of the most impressive artifact collection on the server. 0xymoron is also a small 2b2t youtuber, as he has several livestreams of him exploring and visiting monuments on the sever. He is also a well-known merchant in the field of artifacts and other things. He also owns the website 2b2t.online where people can submit coordinates to old bases / things they found. Despite his love for history, 0xymoron is still a dangerous person to mess with.. He has also griefed many bases, like the [[Castle of Shenandoah]] and [[Rhadamantis]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1505">The 11/11 dupe, also known as the Jump Dupe, was a massive [[Duplication Glitches|duplication glitch]] on the server that occurred on November, 11th, 2016. The easy way to duplicate items was leaked to the 2b2t community by [[RusherIsAutistic]], causing mass duping across the entire server. This was the largest duplication glitch that the server had ever seen, since players were now able to dupe entire shulker boxes full of items at once, rather than just the items themselves.

On 11/19, a client made to make duping easier was spread among the community. However, the client was actually backdoored, and people who duped using the client had their stashes leaked on the 2b2t Reddit. This did not stop players, as there were other clients to use. The 11/11 dupe ended when 2b2t was updated to 1.11 on 11/28.

However, a specific group of players, members of the [[4th Reich]] had another way to duplicate. This was the first method used before other client's were made consisting of other types of kicks which could be used. This method involved using two Minecraft windows which you would login to one and drop an item before being kicked on the other.

== Effects ==
The 11/11 Dupe caused the amount of items in the server to overflow, with most players having double chests of God Apples and other rare items. This basically caused the 2b2t economy to crash and items from the dupe are still in mass circulation today.[[Category:History]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="855">2BGoogle is a [[bot]] that allows players to search for content on Google and YouTube by using the commands !google and !youtube respectively. The search results are then sent via PM to the person who requested the links. The bot was first seen around the server in early August 2017, though the name &quot;2BGoogle&quot; was taken 7/22/2017 according to its [https://namemc.com/profile/2BGoogle.1 NameMC] page. As of June 2018, this bot is not online.

[[File:Example of a 2BGoogle reply.png|none|thumb|450x450px|Example of a 2BGoogle response]]

== Commands ==
!google &lt;search term&gt; - returns the top three results for a search term on Google.

!youtube &lt;search term&gt; - Same as !google but returns the top three results from YouTube

!spell &lt;best attempt at spelling&gt; - Returns a string with the best guess at what you are trying to spell

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6358">2Bot is a bot which was created by aZelda. The original reason behind it's creation was to mock the other spambots at the time with extremely autistic and repetitive messages. Some players believed it was created by [[The Emperium]], but it was not, as it predates the emperium by some time. Currently, 2Bot changed a lot since when he was first introduced to 2b2t back in May of 2017. His history is displayed bellow.

'''&lt;u&gt;Original 2Bot back in May when he was first created:&lt;/u&gt;'''
{{Autism}}
{{Cleanup}}
2Bot is a retarded and cancerous bot that can only memorise 9 lines and spam them all over chat.

2Bot used to be in a safe place, then he stayed at [[spawn]] , waiting to be killed by players. However as of now, 2Bot is in a safe place. His last death by player was about in June 2017. The YouTuber [http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/Torogadude Torogadude] even mentioned that 1 like = 1 prayer for 2Bot's [[autism]] .

2Bot now has an Autistic Discord group with no rules and 1000+ members: [https://discord.gg/X3zWqQb Discord server]

2Bot's original and most popular line is: &gt;2b2t, Free speech at its finest!

2Bot's original lines are:
* &gt;2b2t, Free speech at its finest!
* &gt;Are you new to 2b2t? Spawn is your safe heaven!

2b2t (2builders2tools) is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft Minecraft] anarchy server, and one of the oldest servers in Minecraft. 2b2t started in December 17th/20th (Disputed on the exact date) of 2010, and has had seven years of history built with it. 2b2t is referred to as one of the worst servers in Minecraft due to its nature of having no staff, no rules and no chat filters. The map has been running since 2010 and has not reset since, aside from temporary maps for the playerbase to play on while the server was being fixed in maintenance. The map has only changed once while the map was being updated to fit the new world height limit.

=== History ===
The history of 2b2t is a complicated one, and a more descriptive timeline can be found in: [[Timeline]], which has been recently fixed.

=== Legacy ===
2b2t has left its mark in Minecraft's history, and caused a lot of [[2b2t clones|servers]] to rip off 2b2t with the promise of anarchy. Most of these 2b2t clones use the format #b#t in their server name but several of them don’t follow this format.  2b2t has also been visited by a lot of YouTubers, mostly after 2016, such as [[TheCampingRusher]], [[AgentGB]], ElRichMC, AntVenom, and PopularMMOs.

2b2t also had its history with unique [[memes]] and its inheritance from its first inhabitants, the [[4channers|4chan]] shitposters.

== 2b2t ==
[[2b2t|2builders2tools]], or &quot;2b2t&quot; for short is a Minecraft anarchy server that is also known as the world's worst minecraft server. The server has virtually no rules, no staff, and no chat filters (with the exception of game breaking [[Anti Cheat|anti-cheat]] for things like flight and super speed). The server is the second oldest running server in Minecraft. The current map has been active since December 2010 without a single reset and it is worth over +3000 GB of memory (or 3 terabytes) and has been hosted in Stockholm, Sweden for its entire history. 2b2t offers its players a Minecraft experience which is unparalleled to any other server of the type and is like no other place in videogames.  

The playerbase is typically divided into three major [[Social Classes|groups]]: [[2b2t Terminology|Oldfags, Midfags, and Newfags]]. These groups are based on the age of a player since their join date, and have been common terms since the beginning of 2b2t. Over 205,000 players have joined, but very few have stayed to become oldfags.

There are currently 13 servers based off of 2b2t with each one being the next number of #b#t (ie. 4b4t) with the exception of 3b3t, which was a temp map. The server 3b3t was actually a temp map for 2b2t during the early weeks of 2015. Temporary maps are launched while the main server is unavaible for various reasons as well as during april fools events.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3874">These rules have been set up to prevent the wikia from collapsing or being raided (see [[Jared2013]]). It is mandatory to read the rules before editing, posting, or contributing to the 2b2t wikia. Failure to obey the rules will result in a ban up to 6 months (In case of possible good faith, a warning will be given for the first time a user has acted against the rules. If good faith cannot be assumed (such as when the user spams or blanks pages), a warning is not requiered).
==Page Creation Rules==
*Do not create pages that do not relate to 2b2t
*Do not re-create pages that admins have deleted, unless you have obtained their explicit permission. If you feel that your page has been deleted unjustly, please discuss this on the profile of the admin who has deleted it. If your request for un-deletion was denied, '''do not re-add your page.'''
*Do not create pages that exist only to advertise your fagtion. It'll result in disciplinary action being taken.
*Do not create separate pages that are about tiny and/or unknown bases and groups, as well as random people you've met. They will be moved to [[Regular Players]] or [[Small Groups]]
===Major Build Guidelines===
*All builders should be listed '''(2011/2012 bases are NOT required to list all base members)'''
*Presice creation date (by the month) '''(bases created before June 1st, 2016 are NOT required to have this requirement)'''
*One or more pictures (proof of existance after Eyes of the Zodiac drama)
*Must exist on 2b2t.org
*Must be completed OR greifed '''if pre-planned.'''
*Must have an extensive amount of information/history '''(newer/inactive pages have an exception)'''
'''If our sources/admins believe that a (several) base(s) does not exist, then those pages will be deleted unless if proper evidence has been recieved.'''

=== Minor Group/Faction Guidelines ===
* The group cannot be ''Armorsmith based. ''(ex: trying to get attention by spamming chat and making the group seem godly and claim to accomplish things that they didnt accomplish)
* Must have 2 members (excluding the owner)

==Page Editing Rules==
*If an admin rollbacks your edit, '''do not re-add your edit.''' If you feel that the admin shouldn't have rolled back your edit, discuss it in the page's comments section or on the admin's profile. If your request was denied, '''do not re-add your edit.'''
*Vandalism is not allowed. Disciplinary action will be taken and everything you will do will be rolled back within less than 24h. (You will end up like Jared)
*Do not be biased (example: all newfags are irrlevant)
*Do not destroy the ''tradition'' (ex: making &quot;grammar edits&quot; by removing terms such as newfag)
*Do not add your name to [[Famous Players]] unless if you are actualy relevant (if you just joined, youre a nobody, not a famous player).
*Same applies to Youtubers ^. This isnt a place to advertise your &quot;OLDEST SERVER ON MINEKREFT!!!11111&quot; letsplay.
*Do not, under any circumstances, blank (blanking - the act of deleting all content on a wiki page, leaving it blank. Replacing all page content with gibberish will also count as blanking.) pages. If you feel that something should not exist, add &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Delete}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; at the top of the page and justify your reasons for deletion.
*Fake edit summaries (ie. &quot;grammar fixes&quot; edits that actually delete half of the page, replace it with a copypasta etc.) will add to the ban durations for vandalism.
==Other Rules==
*Obey the (relevant and active) admins
*Being toxic isn't allowed.
*If you see that a page has been vandalized and the admins have not responded for over 24 hours, make a comment on it.
*Do not lie to staff about information.
*Be respectful (and not an asshole) to the staff team
*Do not add false information in general.



More rules will be added soon

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3876">The 2b2t Anarchy Server wiki is a community project on 2b that is open to the entire public in order to preserve written history of the server. The wiki currently has reached over 10000 views, and has a total of 200 articles as of May, 14, 2017

== History ==

=== The Old Wiki ===
[http://2b2t.wikia.com/wiki/2b2t_Wikia The 2B2T Wikia] was founded on July 2nd, 2016, during the Rusher War. It was originally founded by DoctorRobotix (Most likely a Rusher due to the wiki's navigator that calls groups' &quot;Clans&quot;) who abandoned the wiki very early on in its history. He was the only admin on the wiki and so the wiki was highly susceptible to vandals/griefers (Mainly Jeding and TimMcNukepants) and shitposting when he left. However, some players did add history and relevant pages which was buried under the mess of the shitposts (some were TheSnowArmy, Toz76, StealthBlaster, [[Jared2013]], Ppxje, and _Henry).

=== Dark_Annihilator's First Edits ===
On November 17th, 2016, [[Dark_Annihilator]] came on the original 2b2t wiki and began to edit. After experiencing the events of the Rusher War, Dark decided to write down most of the things that happened during the War. After this, he became so intrigued by 2b's history that he began to watch several videos, read old reddit posts, and gain knowledge from various other sources that all pertained to 2b2t. He added several necessary pages and deleted content from shitposts (could not delete pages as that is only an admin command). He contributed to the wiki just about everyday.

Eventually, a small population of players began to make small contributions here and there and began to view the wiki. These players included (but not limited to) JPLanley, Niftyrobo, [[MasicoreLord]], Coltsnid, Stlavs, Memerxdddddmemer1337, MemeCynic ([[HappySeniorMan]]), [[kekkekkek1]], PepsiLord420, Pupperoni ([[DemonElite119]]), and a few others. Griefers and shitposters continued to do their thing but the population kept deleting whatever they made. Nifty came up with the idea to create the 2b2t Anarchy Server wiki in order to have more control over vandalism and shitposting. He eventually founded it on December 21st, 2016.

=== A New Wiki ===
Dark, Nifty, and Masicore began to transfer all the pages from the old wiki to the new one. During this, a few pages were added and Masicore placed several notifications and banners around the old wiki in order for the older editors to see and come to the new one. Overtime, new players began to come to wiki and the more people viewed the wiki, the more people began to edit and bring others which brought a decent amount of players to the wiki everyday. From here, the rest is history and on May 14th, the wiki achieved its 200th page. It has relatively been the same and plenty of people contribute, whether it be small tweaks here and there or pages with full history. Nevertheless, the 2b2t wiki has become a decently sized community project and continues to be a hub for 2b's vast history.

During August of 2017, [[Jared2013]] asked to help the wiki through a reddit post. Niftyrobo had been ashamed of the wiki and so promoted Jared to bureaucrat (god status) to wreak havoc on the wiki. Jared imposed a tyrannical rule over the wiki with him giving strict orders not to make pages that he deemed to be stupid (which was 90% of everything) or get instantly banned. Eventually, the majority of the community of the wiki began to complain about Jared's bias bullshit against anything to do with newfags. A vote was made to demote Nifty and Jared but was soon deleted by Jared. In an autismal outburst and fit of rage, Jared got some of his Spawn Mason buddies and trashed the wiki. However, help was asked from Fandom Staff and they reverted everything that Jared made and blocked him, his buddies, and Niftyrobo, leaving Dark_Annihilator ownership of the wiki.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3459">Despite being an anarchy server, 2b2t has several communities ranging from (seemingly) peaceful builders to merciless spawnfags. Many fights or rants occour on several 2b2t communities such as the subreddit, wiki, clones, just about anywhere else. This page will contain several conflicts that occoured post June 1st, 2016.

'''WARNING: This information can cause some unstable readers to rage. Please read at your own risk.'''

== FitMc ==

== Beardler ==
Beardler was once a trusted and respected player across the 2b2t community. Joining (post June 1st, 2016. WIP), he wanted to help out with the 2b2t museum. He was accepted after donating 150 world downloads of random 2b2t bases (unknown if any of these are real). Later on, he was given operator and console access. Slowly getting attention via his rank on the museum, Beardler was promoted on several other 2b2t communities. Beardler also founded the 2b2t builders guild and explorers guild.

=== Reputation Damage ===
Around late May, Beardler was invited to the Boedecken and Block Game Mecca. Alongside founding the Builders Haven project with Jonathan5454 on May 25th, 2018. A few days after BGM (alongside Boedecken) was leaked and griefed. Each member of BGM was asked to give their logs. Everyone complied, except Beardler. Drama started on the subreddit involving Beardler possibly leaking/griefing BGM. Members of Builders Haven defended Beardler, but not for long. Beardler then admitted that he accidentaly leaked the coords to BGM (because of his awful security) alongside the Builders Haven temp base, [[Purgatory]]. A few days after that, Beardler started to become unstable. In a private server om discord, Beardler admitted griefing Boedecken and BGM. This once again caused mass drama on the subreddit. The result was catastrophic. The 2nd Builders Haven tempbase, [[Purgatory 2]], was griefed for revenge. Beardler also doxxed [[Jared2013]], alongside leaking the coords to unfinished bases on the museum. [[Fit]] took notice and ruined the reputation of the museum (listed as an ip grabber) and builders haven (place to recruit museum members), both of these statements are completly false. Beardler was kicked by his own group, Builders Haven, and raged at one of the new base overseers that Jonathan5454 promoted, Bloctagon. Beardler made several cancerous quotes such as “my patience and respect for you is dwindling with every word you spew. Clean up your act before I work to have you removed. Respect your superiors”,. The chat session was posted on reddit, which memed Beard with haste. Today, Beardler is only a moderator on Jumpinqqs shop and the 2b2t Archive.

== 2b2t Wiki ==
The 2b2t has/had some of the most insane drama out of all of the 2b2t communities. 

=== Creation and the old Wiki ===
The first time the wiki was ever mentioned was in October 2016, where someone was ranting that the wiki was runned by rushers (the picture showing a page called “Veteran Decay”). Infact, this was true. The 2b2t wiki was created by a random rusher. The old wiki was a disorganized mess, filled with bullshit and other Fit/Rusher bullshit. 

Around 2 months later, the new 2b2t wiki was created by the player, Niftyrobo. Niftyrobo barely cared about the wiki. Overtime, random pages were added with false information.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6446">The 2b2t Economy is an idea on 2b2t that discusses the item flow and management amongst players. It has been memed about, theorized about, and debated whether it is simply an abstract idea or a legitimate thing on the server.

== The Economy of 2b2t ==
An economy is obviously the process or system by which goods and services are produced, sold, and bought in a country or region (duh). In other ways of describing it, an economy is the essential flow of consumerism, which is the flow of money from customers, to companies, to employees who then repeat the cycle by becoming the customer (again duh). The prices of an object is determined by supply and demand, whether customers want it or not. If people want something, companies usually jack up the price, if not they lower the price (with the exception of essential items to one's survival, which everyone needs, which only would be a high price if you lived in a shitty country with dictators).

In the server's case, the economy is run by trade rather than a currency system. It is the trading of specific items to another player in order to gain another desired item that essentially makes an economy on 2b an actual thing. Keep in mind that this includes scamming and killing where a player is given a lie or is given an axe in the face for items. This suggests that server is partly capitalist in nature (which in its extreme form, is a form of anarchism).

However, capitalism suggests ownership of items, and in minecraft, players can only truly own what's in their enderchests, and, as long as they are not killed, what's in their inventory as well. When it comes to property and regular chests, 2b's economic status changes completely and shifts into a more communist/collective economy (which also in its extreme form, is a form of anarchism) in which everyone on the server has ownership over your builds and chests (your essentially producing for society and not yourself when you build). There is nothing preventing someone from taking your items if they know where those items are.

However, as a counterpoint, it is worth noting that most players store most of their items in far-out bases and hard-to-find stashes, with the intention of other players not being able to use &quot;their&quot; items. And the vast majority of items on the server are not stored in easy to find places. Because of this, the type of economy is less like a true collective economy and more like some kind of hoarding-based collective economy, where, technically, anyone is allowed to use any items, but people generally hoard, rather than share, their wealth, except with any basemates they may have.

It can be argued that 2b2t is inherently a mutual economy, which is the middle ground between capitalist and collective economies, in which you own some things, but other things are owned by the society, which anyone can simply take.

Of course, the main difference between the economy of 2b2t and the economy of the real world is that, with a few exceptions such as hacked items and map art, anyone can obtain any items they want all by themselves, whereas in real life, division of labor and transactions are needed to obtain most goods and services. Players who live totally isolated from the entire rest of society can have the same possessions and experience the same luxuries as anyone else, simply through their own effort, but in real life, this would not be the case.

== Economic &quot;Crashes&quot; ==
When the economy of 2b2t &quot;crashes&quot;, it's caused by one of three things: a [[Duplication Glitches|duplication glitch]], a [[Backdoors|backdoor]], or any other exploit that involves item creation. This is because when items are overproduced, it causes the value of said items to decrease, meaning that less people will demand for them as they probably already have gazillions of them and will essentially give them out for free.

Now concerning the society of 2b2t, this does virtually nothing. This is because, at this point, almost everything in the vanilla game of Minecraft that is considered valuable has been reduced to being extremely common and everyone is essentially rich and beat the game of Minecraft in itself. However, the handful of items that are still considered valuable and willing to be traded for (i.e. [[map art]] and [[Hacked Items|hacked items]]) have actually seen a price increase. Before dupe glitches, players would probably have to trade a block of diamond for a piece of map art or hacked item, but since dupes have given the vendor tons of diamond blocks, he's most likely going to ask for way more than one diamond block for the valued item. But this is not a problem for the customer for two reasons: most of the remaining valuable items are not necessities (so customers don't have to buy it) and the customer will most likely have enough to pay off the vendor due to him also benefiting from the dupe and having been able to dupe thousands upon thousands of diamond blocks, in which he also finds no longer valuable.

So in a sense, when the economy &quot;crashes&quot; on 2b2t, its essentially a win-win for everyone as everyone can gain almost limitless amounts of necessities and never have to worry about it again and they do not have to waste resources on extra things that they really could live without (unless they want to of course). So, the more inflation, the better.
[[File:Falling-Off-The-Chart.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Live representation of 2b's economy]]

==Rate of 2b's Economy&lt;nowiki/&gt;==
The current rate of 2b's economy is really shitty and Jews from wall street would be having heart attacks. Last year saw its largest drops as a whopping four dupes were discovered (some of them being the biggest in 2b's history). Everything previously valuable in Minecraft is essentially in the hands of noobs, pros, newfags, and oldfags alike. Even the remaining items that are still &quot;valuable&quot; have seen a decrease in value because they were also duped largely.
[[File:Rrgz4eF.png|thumb|220x220px]]

== The &quot;Fix&quot; of the Economy ==
The fix of 2b's economy is essentially if Hause resets everyone's items, including chests, shulker boxes, and ender chests, which would truly make everyone poor and would cause the Great Depression on the server. This would most likely result in protests around the server and several players leaving, so don't expect the economy will get better any time soon.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3919">[[File:Body.png|thumb|164x164px|The original Minecraft skin for the username &quot;2b2tpress&quot;]]
The 2b2t Press (http://2b2t.press) is an anonymous 2b2t media group that is intended to post 2b2t &quot;news&quot; (as in [[memes]] and [[shitposts]]) on their WordPress website, social media accounts, and their Minecraft account &quot;2b2tpress.&quot;  

== History ==
The 2b2t Press first appeared in the 2b2t community in July of 2016 by originally sharing their articles written on http://2b2t.press with the 2b2t subreddit. 

The domain name &quot;2b2t.press&quot; was initially created on July 21, 2016&lt;ref&gt;https://www.whois.com/whois/2b2t.press&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Mastery of Shitposting ==
The articles on the 2b2t Press website appeared to be satirical, mostly fake, [[shitposts]]. From the grammar, spelling, and overall aesthetic of the website, it would appear that the &quot;journalists&quot; of the 2b2t Press took a lot of time to make their content appear as if it were written by a child.

The website was hosted with WordPress blogging software and had a custom or modified theme created by 2b2t Press. The website was (probably) intentionally terribly designed with minimal CSS styling, obnoxious colors, and oddly sized margins.

Spelling errors were also a continuous theme with the 2b2t Press website, the articles, and the social media accounts associated with the 2b2t Press. Note the a section from the original footer on the website:&lt;blockquote&gt;website designed by profesionals with latest css3 and html5 technologes&lt;/blockquote&gt;Most of the articles written by the 2b2t Press group also contained various terrible stock images with blatantly obvious watermarks. It is assumed that this was to give the posts less of an appeal to logos, as it seems the intentions of the group were to gain attention from how horrible the posts actually were.

== Community Involvement ==
2b2t Press have a Twitter, Reddit, and YouTube account. 

The Reddit account was most active, which is where they shared a majority of their posts with the 2b2t community on the 2b2t subreddit. They responded to many other posts and gave other input on the subreddit as well. 

The Twitter account was mostly used to rally attention to the blog posts as well as provide quick updates to followers of the group. 
[[File:-2b2t press headline- 2b2t rusher aniversary presentation|thumb|330x330px]]
The YouTube account only contains 1 video produced by the group for the 1 year anniversary of [[The Rusher War]]. The video covers the history of the event in a low-resolution PowerPoint presentation given by one of the 2b2t Press group members supposedly. 

According to namemc.com, the &quot;2b2tpress&quot; Minecraft account was changed to &quot;mineDonaldTrump&quot; in April of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://namemc.com/profile/mineDonaldTrump.1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shutdown Drama ==
Following the shutdown of their website, 2b2t Press created a petition on change.org claiming that Verizon had shutdown their services. &lt;blockquote&gt;in december of 2016 our precious website http:/2b2t.press/, which we 
spent alot of time organizing and creating, was shut down by our 
providor Verizon.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.change.org/p/verizon-verizon-must-stop-censoring-trump-supporting-websites&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[File:Logo-1.png|thumb|220x220px|The updated logo used since October, 2017 for the 2b2t.press website and social media accounts.]]The claim alleged that Verizon had shutdown the 2b2t Press for endorsing U.S. presidential candidate, Donald J. Trump.

In October of 2017, nearly 1 year after the group's disappearance, the 2b2t Press returned for a short period. A new logo was created and the website was up for a brief amount of time.

It is unclear whether the 2b2t Press is still active. The official 2b2t Press Twitter, Reddit, and YouTube accounts have been inactive for some time.

'''2b2ter''' - Someone who plays 2b2t.

'''Alt (Account)'''- Alternate accounts used by players. They may be used by more known players to avoid detection.

'''Autism''' - Autistic is a common term on 2b2t to describe someone or something which is dumb or cancerous.

'''Coords '''- Short for &quot;coordinates.&quot; Every Minecraft world has x,y,z coordinates that are used to identify the location of something. 

'''Cancerous''' - Used to describe when someone who talks about random bullshit that is overall fucked up and makes people cringe.

'''Fagtions''' - Fagtions is a term used by players on 2b2t; Used primarily by oldfags as an insult towards groups founded during and after [[the Rusher War]]. They call these groups this because of [[TheCampingRusher]], who was known to regularly play [[The Archon|factions servers]]. This caused a large amount of Rusher's fans to attempt to create several small factions to differentiate themselves from the warring groups during the Rusher War and treat 2b2t as a faction server rather than an anarchy server. Before you knew it, there were small factions literally everywhere and everyone (not only Rushers) claimed be in some sort of group in one way shape or form. However, most of these small factions died out the first couple of days (if they even lasted a day) of their existence, which was humorous to the regular players of the server, which led to the oldfags calling these groups fagtions and irrelevant newfags for obvious reasons.

'''Hello''' - the default message for the Aristois Chatspammer, often used by players to spam annoying and repeating messages, so much that at points the chat is filled with Hello messages.

K'''ek/Topkek '''- Kek means LOL. Topkek means something is really funny or is short for LMAO. It originated from World of Warcraft when people who are a part of the Horde faction would laugh at those on the Alliance faction with terms like &quot;lol&quot; or &quot;haha&quot;. It is a translation of Orcish to Common, as Common is the shared language between the various Alliance races, with Orcish being the equivalent to Common as the Horde's shared language. 

'''Lagfags''' - Players who purposely lag the server using [[Lag Machines|lag machines]] in order to annoy other players in an attempt to become &quot;infamous&quot;. Not all players who operate lag machines are lagfags, as it is seen as acceptable by many to cause lag in order to deter large amounts of newfags from joining the server (autistic due to how it makes escaping spawn extremelly easy by slowing down withers, drowning and possibly also hunger). Some lag machines are so powerful they can get everyone stuck in something akin to adventure mode, when blocks can only be broken is the player posesses a tool that can do this instantly. The most common lag machine design uses an exploit in the plugin PandaWire and was made by 2F4U.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2674">2b2t clones are servers based off of [[2b2t]]. These servers mimic 2b2t to varying degrees.

Most of these servers were made during [[the Rusher War]], due to the sudden popularity and demand for 2b2t and anarchy. 3b3t is the only exception, being the first 2b2t clone, made in 2015 by [[Hause]].

These servers are often used as temporary place to play while waiting in 2b2t's [[queue]].

'''Zion''', colloquially known as '''2k2k''', is one of the most notable monuments near [[Spawn|spawn]] on 2b2t. The base's colloquial name was given by the players of 2b2t due to its coordinates being close to X:-2000, Z:-2000. The base was the last known base of the Facepunch Republics before their disbandment. The base was built sometime in June of 2012.

== History ==
{{2B2T_Build_Template|status = Griefed|coordinates = X: -2000, Z:-2000|image1 = KKjIwya.png|builder(s) = Facepunch Republic|caption1 = 2k2k before it's grief to oblivion|type = Stronghold|demolishers = 4channers|realm = Overworld|approx_date_construction_began = Sometime after February 2012|approx_date_finished = Sometime before June 2012|approx_date_leaked = Sometime in June 2012|leaker = A 4channer|approx_date_demolished = Sometime in June 2012}}[[File:0RuL6.png|thumb|220x220px]]In the final days of the destruction of [[the Facepunch War]], 2k2k served as the last base and stronghold for the [[Facepunch Republic]]. At this point, the Republic was in shambles. [[Chezhead]] lead the Republic poorly and the [[4channers]] were quickly pressing in. Chezhead gave up on the Republic, and so the remaining Facepunchers tried to keep it together but failed and the Republic died in February 2012. One of the last bands of Facepunchers still loyal to their fallen Republic, lead by Phagocytic, decided to create a spawn base in order to continuously rebuild the base in hopes that the 4channers would eventually give up on destroying the base. The base had been destroyed several times but the Republic persisted to rebuild it and fight off opponents.

The Facepunchers gradually began to get tired of rebuilding the base and many lost hope. Due to this, the Facepunchers lost their final stand and with this defeat, the last of the old Republic was destroyed with 2k2k being obliterated sometime in June of 2012.

2k2k now lies in a large cobblestone tomb, after tens, possibly hundreds of [[Lavacast|lavacasts]] were dumped upon it. Some of its original structure remains and people have done some restoration among the tomb, with many restored rooms being discoverable within the cobblestone hell. Of course, these don't last too long but people continue to restore nonetheless. It is also possible to get lost in the vast catacomb of cobblestone and death if you do not know how to navigate yourself through it.

== Architecture ==
Since the base was built around the same time of when Beta 1.7.3 was released, the fortress was not constructed with stone bricks as they had not been added yet. Instead, Facepunchers created the base out of cobblestone. Despite this, the group managed to make incredibly detailed hallways and arches that truly gave it an ancient feeling. [[File:EpiYz.png|thumb|220x220px]]

== Trivia ==
* While many people think that 2k2k is located at X:2000 Z:2000, its actual coordinates are X:-2000 Z:-2000. This led to the positive 2k2k being lavacasted over many times due to the confusion, while the actual location of 2k2k, while still lavacasted, is minuscule in comparison.

The 4channers was a decentralized group of players who were against the [[Facepunch]] idea of peaceful anarchy. The group was mainly comprised of people from 4chan, however did have a mix of people from other places. The group had no leader, base, or organization whatsoever and their sole purpose was to hunt down every last Facepuncher on the server. The group stalked, griefed, and killed several Facepunchers, which lead to the group's disband. The group eventually disbanded once the Facepunchers left and followed their Facepunch enemies to go solo or join other groups. Some ex-4channers and ex-Facepunchers ended up joining the same groups despite their previous animosity.

== History ==
In the early days of 2b2t, the server initially gained popularity from 4chan. The word &quot;4channer&quot; was originally used for anyone who came on to the server from 4chan. These &quot;4channers&quot; who wished to play on an online server couldn’t identify with the existing anarchy servers and also their admins. So 2b2t was - especially for /v/ and /b/ people - the place they wanted to play Minecraft online. The server started to be advertised on 4chan almost daily. People started to get online more and more. Spawn probably received the first wave of destruction at this point. The game was still on beta or alpha at the time. The group eventually formed when players from www.facepunch.com began to join the server and tried to calm the tides of anarchy.

== Trivia ==
* For the most part, the 4channers made up most of the server population when the Facepunchers came along. It is estimated that 70% of the population was from 4chan, while 30% was from Facepunch, SomethingAwful, DeviantArt, and Reddit.
* The 4channers were the first to come up with the [[Social Classes]] that we see today because of their cancerous nature. They also were the ones to bring [[swastikas]] to the server as well.

6Garden is a base built by Jonathan5454 that started on November 22nd, 2016, and finished on 10/2/2017. Mostly consisting of Oak trees, Lapis Blocks, Dark Oak Blocks, Sandstone, Peonies, Lilacs, and Diamond Blocks.{{2B2T_Build_Template|title1 = 6Garden|image1 = 6Garden.png|caption1 = One of the roads in 6Garden|status = |players_who_live(d)_here = Jonathan5454|approx_date_construction_began = 11/22/2016 (exact)|approx_date_finished = 10/2/2017 (exact)|builder(s) = Jonathan5454|approx_date_demolished = Ungreifed|coordinates = Private|approx_date_leaked = |leaker = }}While 6Garden was started in 2016, (Jonathan5454s house) the main construction started in January 2017. Being one of the first 2017 builds on 2b2t.

6Garden has allready out-lived several 2017 and 2018 bases, due to the fact that there is only one builder involved.

Sometime around in Febuary 2017, Jonathan5454 went to spawn and invited Firefox18, (inactive status) but got [[Suicide Bombing (Crystal/Bed Bombing)|crystaled]] a few minutes later by an unknown player.

The size of 6Garden is roughly 184 x 281 blocks.

As of 7/16/2018 6Garden is ungreifed. (When you are the only one at your base).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4268">700Base was a small spawn base built by[[ xcc2]] , Omaliymix, [[x0XP]] , Lichtenburg, zxcwbz1, and others in 2013. The base was, as the name implies, 700 blocks away from[[ spawn]] . The bases ruins can still probably be found around spawn

== History ==
'''Note: This was written by xcc2 on the subreddit'''

'''Disclaimer: No TL;DR, read it or don’t.'''

'''Link: '''https://www.reddit.com/comments/8q1akz

I was recently traveling around spawn and I ran across some ruins that looked familiar. After some head-scratching I remembered where I was and thought I'd take a WDL and make a render. First, the render. It's not a great image or anything, but here you go:

Unnamed Base Near Spawn

Now for the history: It seems like 2013 was one of the busiest times in 2b2t's history (or at least my history on 2b2t). Most of the original builds that I did, and the large bases that I was most active in, were made in 2013. At some point in early 2013 I had teamed up with Omaliymix to build a somewhat famous base at spawn which ultimately became known as 700Base. It was only 700 blocks from spawn and we basically started it by rebuilding some old ruins (I had the task of restoring the castle on the hill) and expanding until it got griefed, knowing it wouldn't last long. The base began in February and ultimately grew very quickly as several people joined us and expanded it; x0xp, Lichtenburg, zxcwbz1, slow_dive, polly_the_parrot, popbob, dr0ndeh and cytotoxictcell, as far as I can remember. The base lasted longer than it had any right to, and ultimately crumbled. This was it's final state:

700Base - Mid 2013

When it fell, Omaliymix and myself quickly regrouped and moved to another location, also not too far from spawn (-1200, -1000). Again, this started as locating an existing ruin, repairing it, and expanding. Also, as before, I took on the task of restoring the original structure (the castle on the hill), and other people showed up to contribute. I built an observatory with a snow dome, slow_dive came and built a small sandstone temple as a tribute to the large one I made at Kaamtown. Someone showed up and made farms, I'm honestly not sure who it was. Cyto went nuts, and created a cool twin cylinder stonebrick thing, and I believe also the ice tower; both of which you can find the ruins of today. Omaliymix worked on a very large castle complex, which is completely buried under the large lavacast.

This base didn't last long and was griefed after maybe a month. We never kept loot there, and just used it as a place to hang out and build together, just like the 700Base. With minor griefing it was abandoned and we moved on. Not too long after it was abandoned one of the famous 2b2t dupes was discovered. I think this one involved using a minecart and freecam. Omal and some others went out to this base near spawn and used it to dupe a ton of stuff. At one point, someone (unknown builder - possibly jacktherippa or offtopia) constructed the obsidian statue with the axe, which can still be seen in the current render, and also placed a ton of spawners. I came and took a single screenshot, which is the only shot I have of the base, sadly after it had been griefed already, and not a very good angle of the whole base. I never took a WDL of this place.

Base Near Spawn - Unnamed

You can see Cyto's stonebrick build in the background, and the edge of my observatory's snow dome in this screenshot. Anyway, no real point to this post, other than to give a snapshot of life on 2b2t back in 2013. Frequently myself and one or two trusted people would forge out and find a spot to build in, and then invite other regulars who we maybe didn't even know very well at the time to come and build. We didn't really care if we got griefed eventually; the idea was just to have some fun building something and see how long it might last. That's why we never bothered to travel out a million blocks hide forever. I know it seems foolish to put the time and effort into these places that are so nearby spawn and will be found quickly, but it was really more about just hanging out and chatting/building something.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4740">'''[[Timeline|Timeline of 2b2t]]'''

&lt;--- [[Pre-Hype Period]]{{Infobox: History|title1 = Age of Hype|date = June 1st, 2016 - Late December 2016|length = Approximately 7 months|player_rate = 150-1300}}---&gt; [[Grand Retard Period]]

The Age of Hype is a large period of time in 2b2t history. The era started when [[TheCampingRusher]] joined 2b2t and causes a massive increase in player rate. This is one of the most documented and historic periods in 2b2t. This period is centered around [[The Rusher War]].

== The Rusher War ==
[[The Rusher War]] is the largest war ever seen on 2b2t. It started when a popular Minecraft youtuber named [[TheCampingRusher]] started a lets play series about 2b2t. This caused hundreds of his fans to flood the server, causing the server to have a queue system implemented to keep the server's systems afloat. At one time the queue exceeded 1,800 players. [[Team Veteran]] was formed to counteract the Rusher invasion, as they started what is known as The Rusher Massacre. The Rusher War ended on October 9th, 2016, when Rusher did not post a video for over a month. Rusher did return but his return did not re-trigger the war and he later left on October 22nd, 2016.

== Rise of the Queue ==
Following the start of TheCampingRusher's entry on 2b2t, the server exploded, from having lower than 50 players to having a queue in excess of 1000 players. The old queue was set up in a way where you had to reconnect to update your position in the queue, thus encouraging the use of hacked clients and Auto Reconnect. This was further worsened during the war, to the point where the queue would reach above 2000 players. Players had to wait up to 14 hours just to play in 2b2t, and this was hated by everyone. The Veterans wanted to enter faster so they can level spawn, and Rusher wants to enter faster so he could make 2b2t episodes on schedule. 

Eventually Rusher made a proposal to Hause, however Hause refused. Hause however, agreed for a compromise; to make the Priority Queue and the Veteran Queue (for players that joined before June 1st, 2016), in which the former is owned by Rusher himself.

The Queue system worked in the way that at the bottom would be &quot;The Standard Queue&quot;,Newfags who didn't use their mom's credit card. The Veteran Queue Was for players who as previously mentioned, basically got put ahead of everyone besides priority (later changed to that they would get placed around 40-50 position in the queue.

== Drama ==
The Rusher War caused great drama across the server. This was mainly because of GoDz and Napkin's drama and the Torogadude Incident. The Torogadude Incident revealed that Hause and Rusher had the previously mentioned deal, and Rusher was able to own the new priority queue. Players were angered when it was revealed that Rusher gave priority queue to his friends. Veterans declared that Hause sold the server out. This was further worsened when Torogadude got stripped of his Priority Queue access by Rusher. 

== Post-War ==
After the war, most players began to lose interest in the server, and others remained to repair damaged monuments ((such as the Valley of Wheat)Good Luck). However, large events also occurred shortly after the end of the Rusher War.

=== 11/11 Dupe and the Fifth Incursion ===
On the 11th of November there was a new massive dupe in 2b2t. It was much more productive than the Nether Portal dupe, and so players began to spam the dupe until the server would reach critical lag spikes. This also caused a massive increase in item stock. Everyone received so many items that they were extremely powerful with the amounts of god sets and god apples they had procured. Some state that even Rushers were able to get hold of the dupe. The dupe was so popular that a hacked client spread around the 2b2t Subreddit. The hacked client made doing the dupe much easier, however this is/was backdoored and most players lost everything because of it. 

Players had so much armor that Fit was predicting an incursion when he talked about it in his video, and he was partially correct. Although combat was minimal, the Fifth Incursion mainly centered on leveling spawn and keeping spawnfags out. 

=== The French Scare ===
On the 25th of November, a French YouTuber with 600,000 subscribers named AgentGB joined the server. This caused lots of commotion around the community, and everyone thought that a new Rusher had joined the server. However, all AgentGB did in his 2b2t video was walk around spawn for 8 minutes until the server closed for the 1.11 update. He later stated that 2b2t won't become a series of his.[[File:Timeline 2016 (2)-1.png|centre|thumb|164x164px]]

[https://www.youtube.com/user/Agenlgar AgentGB is a French Minecraft Youtuber] with over 818k subscribers. He calls his fanbase &quot;les petit trolls&quot; which translates to &quot;the little trolls&quot; in English. On November 25th, 2016 he published a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09xfTqySUHE video about 2b2t], causing much controversy.  

== Reaction ==
As soon as AgentGB's video was found by the 2b2t community, [[Team Veteran]] leader [[Fit]], believing that a situation similar to what [[TheCampingRusher]] had created 5 months before was going to happen, immediately made a call to arms, telling his followers to go to spawn and kill all French-speaking players.(NOTE: the video has since been removed from Fit's YouTube channel).[[File:Photo (1).jpg|thumb|220x220px]]
[[File:Download (2).jpg|thumb|220x220px]]

== Drama ==
After his video about 2b2t, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bNBRRCYHG8 he made a video] about why he was insulted by the Americans on his YouTube channel on November 29th, 2016. He realised that he bothered the Veterans on the server and that he got tons of hate and insults in the comments. Mainly he found the hate both funny and really ridiculous. He commented on Fit's video saying that he was laughing so hard when he saw the french memes on the 2b2t subreddit and that he hopes the server will stay forever and that he respects the veterans on the server (obviously getting tons of hate on that comment).

He explained to his fans, who were extremely confused on why he was getting so much hate, that apparently players on 2b2t don't accept YouTubers on their server and that they apparently don't accept French people either (Which is false, they didn't accept french people ever since AgentGB made the 2b2t video). He explained in his video that You tubers are commentators and that people need to be careful about what they say on the internet because when YouTubers get insulted like this, they read it and it's not like television where people can yell at and insult the commentators and the commentators won't hear it.

Fit himself received some drama, with many of his critics claiming his call to arms was him trying to cash in on a new YouTuber coming to 2b2t, in the similar fashion they accuse him of doing with TheCampingRusher. Fit has brushed off those claims.

=== Since AgentGB's video ===
Since his video in November 2016, AgentGB has still yet to return to the server and make videos. As time goes on, it seems extremely unlikely he will ever return. As for his fans, it is unknown if any of them joined, as plenty of people were making memes and shitposting about being French in the weeks and months after the affair.[[Category:People]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3525">Airships (more commonly known as flying machines) are redstone contraptions used by players to fly around the server. There are many variations of airships that can be built. A lot of oldfags have their own designs which brings a small bit of uniqueness in airships. Some are more complex and some are much more simple.

== Materials ==
Most airships require the following:
* Slime Blocks (somewhat difficult to acquire)
* Redstone Blocks (easy to acquire)
* Sticky Pistons (somewhat easy to acquire)
* Minecart/Boat (easy to acquire)
Please note that extra blocks may be required depending on the design.

== Variants used on 2b2t ==
[[File:Basti's Bomber.png|thumb|220x220px|Basti's Bomber being used for Offtopia's Drain]]
'''Basti's Bomber- '''an airship built by [[BastiVC]] with the intention more to be a bomber rather than a passenger plane (however can be used as one by adding extra blocks). It is equipped with duped tnt, allowing it to rain tnt indefinitely. It is capable of carpet bombing large areas. According to [[Fit]] , it is more destructive than a wither.
[[File:(2) The Simian Shuttle.png|thumb|220x220px|Simian Shuttle Replica]]
[[File:(1) Launch of Avalon Air.png|thumb|220x220px|A Simian Shuttle]]
It was intended to be used by [[the Blind Eye Clan]] in order to level [[spawn]] but never happened due to the Clan constantly being interrupted and disbanding. It was eventually used by [[Team Veteran ]] for an attempt to bomb [[File:Hqdefault (1)-0.jpg|thumb|184x184px|Fit's Original Airship]]spawn in order to make spawn more difficult to navigate than it already was for [[Rushers]] . The bomber created what is known as Basti's canyon in a test run by Team Veteran during [[the Rusher War]] . Team Veteran then abandoned the attempt. The bomber design has also been used to clear the hole for [[Offtopia's Drain|Offtopia's Base, The Drain.]]

'''Fit's Airship- '''An airship designed by [[Fit]] in which players can use to travel long distances or traverse over the chasms of the End. It has recently been upgraded to include the new observer block. Fit used these airships to perform the first manned flight over spawn, beat the minecraft airship flight record, and to build in the end.

'''Simian Shuttles- '''Simian Shuttles were built by the players inhabiting [[Avalon City]] and were first flight tested on May 27th, 2015. The City included an airport in which the builders called &quot;Avalon Air&quot; where players could fly off these airships and could tour the base and land on several landing pads scattered around the city.
[[File:Maxresdefault (5)-1.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Fit's Reformed Airship]]


'''Ice Airship- '''An airship platform that was designed by ilmango who is not a player of 2b2t. However, players of 2b2t have found his design and used it for the creation of a Water Cube that used to flood spawn. The airship creates infinite ice by constantly making an infinite water source and then continuously freezes it. An older design required the use of an armor stand but has be removed in newer models. 

&lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt; 

The above is false, the airships used were not based on this principle. To make the watercube, flip just manually got two sides done manually and used a flying platform to spread the water as shown in

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2123">[[File:Capture-1493083082.PNG|thumb|220x220px]]
Alpha Leaves are a broken version of leaves. Nobody knows exactly why they exist. A possible explanation is that in beta 1.2, when birch and spruce trees were added, all existing leaves placed as blocks were randomly converted into either oak leaves or the new birch leaves, as the data value formerly indicating leaf type was changed to indicate leaf decay. Leaves that were not placed, and instead were items in the inventories and chests of players, remained as the old leaf type, which now had its item texture removed but was otherwise the same.

However, leaves were not legitimately obtainable at the time, as shears weren't added until beta 1.7, and experiments with trying to obtain alpha leaves in this way have been inconclusive. But, since Minecraft used to have less inbuilt security measures, and hacked clients could do things they can't now, such as hacking in items with a regular client instead of having to use a backdoor, it is possible that leaf items were hacked in before beta 1.2, and those items were then corrupted when the update happened. And since leaves were not obtainable otherwise, they would have been one of the most common items to hack in. But no one knows for sure.

Like [[Fake Wooden Slabs]], alpha leaves appear in inventory and storage slots as a pink and black checkerboard, which is used by Minecraft to indicate a missing item texture. When held in a player’s or zombie’s hand, they appear as oversized boxes, the size of a placed block, in the hand, with the pink and black error texture on all sides. When placed, they look like normal oak leaves. When put into an item frame, the item frame displays a pink and black checkered cube that takes up almost the entire frame.

Alpha leaves are no longer obtainable, and a way to obtain them in current versions, other than [[Duplication Glitches|duping]] existing alpha leaves or spawning them in with commands, is currently unknown, and probably not possible. In 1.13, they will be removed, and all former alpha leaves will be converted to normal oak leaves.

AntVenom, also referred to as simply Ant, is a YouTuber with over 2 million subscribers. He is most notable for being the reason the 6th Incursion started because of his video uploaded on April 3rd ,2018 called &quot;The Face of Minecraft Anarchy&quot;.
== Events ==
The 2b2t community was divided about AntVenom making a 2b2t video. Claims were made that AntVenom's fanbase is much more mature than [[TheCampingRusher]]'s, and will treat the server with a lot more respect. AntVenom himself stated on reddit that his goal for the video about 2b2t will be more of a history lesson than an actual &quot;COME AND PLAY&quot; series. Ant has stated that he does not intend if people do happen to rush(kek get it) to join the server. Several old and midfags actually gave him the thumbs up to make a video or two.  
[[File:Antvenom.jpg|thumb|220x220px]]
[[File:O0b6w.png|thumb|405x405px]]

Torogadude said he expects fans of AntVenom's to come onto the server and be able to create a new era of peace and not be toxic and cancerous like several 2b2t players are. He predicted that the fans of AntVenom might be builders rather than griefers and PKers, like Rusher's fans, and that they will be more intelligent to escape spawn and have a presence in the 2b2t community. He claimed that Ant's videos are more technical and talk about knowledgeable things about minecraft compared to Rusher's videos, which are mainly faction videos filled with PvP and action (hence the Rusherfag violence and toxicity).

AntVenom has said that he's &quot;been well aware of the server for quite a while&quot; and decided to recently take a look after [https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t/comments/5hzjkj/ant_wants_to_talk_with_the_admins_of_2b2t/ Ghost_Rock_'s tweet to him], replying to ImportedSocks being credited to a minecraft glitch AntVenom covered in a video. AntVenom talked to Hausemaster about the server before joining.

Despite the attention, AntVenom stated he had lost interest in making videos in general and that it comes and goes for him, so he did not make the video during the summer of 2017. However, he came up with the title for it, and was found by the community. The title was  &quot;The Face of Minecraft Anarchy&quot;. In fact, he commented &quot;Top Tier LULZ&quot; on a fake account with his name that used the name of his video in a meme tease video on June 1st, 2017. After this, the Ant anticipation died down.

But would you expect, on April 3rd, 2018, he finally made the long expected video. He used the original title he came up with, which is more of a correct name for a video talking about 2b2t, and less-clickbaity like &quot;THE OLDEST SERVER IN MINECRAFT&quot;, emphasizing the difference between the demographics of Rusher's and Ant's fanbase. In the video, Ant kept his promise of making more of a history-esc video and an explanation of its wonders rather than a let's play.  

To get footage for his video, Ant physically joined the server, receiving a set of god armor and gapples from an unknown player (he blurred the name). Before the video was even uploaded, the Sixth Incursion was declared by Sato86 and Fit opened Team Veteran up again in anticipation of a fan invasion. Sure enough, the fans began to trickle in and the Sixth Incursion begun. The influx was not as large as the Rusher War, despite Ant having double Rusher's subscriber count, therefore not causing a full scale war, but it was not as small as the French and Spanish Crises to turn a blind eye, hence the Incursion. The reason for a smaller influx was possibly because the video was not posted in the summer, intentionally or unintentionally, but if it was it may have caused more traffic to the server as students would be out of school.

== Relations ==
Due to him being a popular YouTuber with over 2 million subscribers but being more of a mature and classical minecraft youtuber, the whole 2b2t community had divided thoughts on him, even before he joined. People were divided on whether to greet him with open arms or to resurrect Team Veteran and create another Rusher War-esc fiasco. Ant, in his video, has acknowledged the fact that the community is divided on his presence. But Ant has tended to show respect to the community and the server itself throughout his focus on 2b2t, which, at the end of the day, shows that he is, at the very least, better than Rusher. 

During the 6th Incursion, it was noted that PopularMMOs was spotted on the server and later killed during the Incursion. As Ant knows PopularMMOs personally, since they are both classics and all, Ant was told by MMOs that he wasn't planning to create content on the server, which Ant later stated on a post on the subreddit. By the end of the Incursion, it was found out that PopularMMOs was on the server &quot;just for fun&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3080">Anti Cheat are plugins added to minecraft servers to prevent players from hacking. When it comes to 2b2t, and several other anarchy servers, anti cheat has been implemented, however, usually to prevent extreme forms of hacking (flying, super speed, etc.) in order to provide a fair gameplay on the server, while less OP forms are usually accepted (Jesus, Kill Aura, etc.).

This page will explain the various forms of anti cheats implemented into 2b2t and their discrepancies and criticism.

== NCP ==
NoCheatPlus (or simply NCP) has been the anti cheat implemented by [[Hause]] since the rise of server networks, plugins, and hacked clients way back during the full release days of minecraft. NCP can be administered by plugin companies such as Bukkit or, in 2b's case, Spigot.

The anticheat gained a lot of criticism by early players as they could no longer fly around or go insane speeds. People bashed Hause because of this and criticized that the anti cheat prevented true anarchy. Despite critics, Hause never removed the anticheat and it has been a part of the server until getting replaced by AAC.

The anticheat, over time, became somewhat praised by the community due to the fact that it prevents game breaking hacks but yet, for the most part, allows normal cheats like Kill Aura and things of that nature, allowing for some of the true anarchy to remain on the server.

== AAC ==
Advanced Anti Cheat (or simply AAC) is another anti-cheat implemented into 2b2t by either Hause or [[Curtis]] . The anti cheat was implemented sometime in April 25th, 2017 and removed some time in Late April/Early May. It is administered solely by Spigot.

The anticheat was very criticized as players, like [[torogadude]] , have noted that the anticheat prevented many normal hacks, unlike NCP which to a degree did so but for the most part did not. Things like speed mining, kill aura, jesus, and slower speed hacks were known to kick players from the server.

The anticheat was rendering many of the most popular [[Cheat Clients|cheat clients ]]on the server, such as Impact, Future, and Wurst, almost useless. Players had to be conscience about how much they use their regular hacks. In fact, even players without hacks were kicked due to horrendous lag. Hause was sent hundreds of emails on the day it was added in order for it to be removed. According to reports, 90 players, including no hack players, were kicked on the first day.

== Revert to NCP (AAC's Fail) ==
Eventually, due to lots of critiscism and issues Hause eventually listened and reverted the anti cheat back to NCP. This was most likely due to an update in NCP and that the Apocalypse Exploit has been patched due to an IRC plugin that was implemented in order to fix the source code and tracks issues.

== Revert Back to AAC ==
In early April of 2018 2b2t went back to AAC for unknown reasons. It is the the current anti-cheat on the server and doesn't seem to be leaving anytime soon, despite the various issues it has been causing and the many complaints about it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2078">[[Hausemaster]] /[[Curtis]] ' April fools map for 2b2t. The map was put into place on April 2, 2017 and was taken down on April 3, 2017, with the regular 2b2t map taking its place. The map [https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t/comments/651dnk/1st_april_world/ was put up for download] [https://puu.sh/vkIRV/259f53328d.rar (alternative link if that is broken)] on /r/2b2t on April 13, 2017 by /u/2builders2tools (presumably Curtis), and was stickied to the front page of the sub.

== Hacked by [[Team Rusher]] ==
The queue was removed from the server entirely, allowing for players to instantly join into the fray as they pleased. The server's MOTD was set to the Green and Cyan repeating message: HACKED BY #TEAMRUSHER. The same also applied to the ingame tab menu. Hundreds of players were online simultaneously, nearing the point where a typical Minecraft server begins to show signs of very noticeable lag. The world border was set to the meager size of 400x400 and was set primarily in an Extreme Hills/Taiga biome, hitting the height limit in a few places. Mobs that spawned on the map would drop valuable items according to a predetermined loot table. There were settings added for generated structures such as Villages and Strongholds but the seed did not generate these structures within the world border limit.

The custom loot tables dropped the following specialty items for each mob:
# Chicken: Spawn eggs
# Cow: Books &amp; Spawn Eggs
# Creeper: TNT &amp; Spawn Eggs
# Enderman: Cooked chicken, Watermelons and Spawn Eggs
# Endermite: Ender pearls
# Ghast: End Crystal &amp; Obsidian
# Rabbits: Ender Chest
# Sheep: Painting (How artistic of them!)
# Skeleton: Ender Pearl &amp; Spawn Eggs
# Spider: Spawn Eggs
# Villager: Emerald block
# Zombie: Golden Apple &amp; Spawn Eggs
# Pigman: Gold block
# Zombie Villager: A single golden nugget.

During the tempmap, there was a plugin installed which converted all messages sent in chat to be spoken in a Neckbeardspeek tongue of English.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1611">April Fools Maps are [[Temp Maps|temp maps]] created, usually by [[Hause]] , on April 1st of each year to celebrate it. These maps usually include strange and wacky features to add to [[Memes|memery]], and are small and confined, which usually leads to large warzones and general widespread chaos and destructionas players fight over the limited space and resources. These maps are not on the regular 2b2t map, and are sometimes made on separate servers, or sometimes on the same one. Hause has done these maps since the start of 2b2t.

Maps with known description: 
*2014 - The 2014 April Fools map was mainly a warzone due to two groups, known as TOPKEK and WOODSTOCK, being after each other. The normal server featured a notice stating that the server was hacked and deleted and that Hause was dox'd, however this was a joke.
*2015 - The 2015 April Fools map was ISIS themed with music and everything.
*2016 - In the months before [[the Rusher War]] , the 2016 map was hosted on a separate server owned by [[Spartan512]].
*2017 - (''See More [[April Fools Map 2017]]'') This map had several wacky loot tables and chaos. The queue was removed temporarily.
*2018 - This map had crazy custom terrain and ore generation. The queue was removed for the span of the couple days it was online and there was an ender dragon spawned in. The first few hours of the sixth incursion started here, as it was confirmed AntVenom's video would be coming within 24 hours. Players from multiple groups banded together and killed the ender dragon.

He is the leader of Armorsmith's Followers, a religious &quot;cult&quot; movement he made where he declared himself a &quot;god&quot; on 2b.

He became known for building lag machines on the server. He also reached the end world border corner by elytra packet flying, lagging the server in the process.

Armorsmith is known to be one of the most, if the not the most, hated player that has ever joined 2b2t and tends to seek relevancy in the community.

== History ==
Armorsmith joined 2b2t in June 2016. He wasn't active for almost a year, due to the long queue and made wooden huts. He re-joined in the middle of 2017 with the simple goal of making everyone triggered and calling attention to himself. And so he did, by building lag machines. His first lag machine was called &quot;The Valley of Signs&quot;, due to the many signs placed due to AutoSign. The lag machine was later destroyed. 

He went on to build a second one, Carolina. This lag machine used a method by 2F4U and it was built in times when Hausemaster didn't care much about these builds. Armorsmith would use this lag machine for months, making him hated by almost every player on 2b2t as it would bring decent drops to tps and would be annoying.

When his lag machine got deleted by Hause, Armorsmith decided to become the first player to ever see the world border at the End, and so he went on a journey that lasted an entire week. When he arrived there, he built a ibase at the end world border corner - Armorland.

Armorsmith would later work on other lag machines and other bases, collecting rare items such as the signs left by ElRichMC and griefing bases and public infrastructure such as highways and map art outposts (the maps were used to create his two museums).

Armorsmith would later declare himself as a &quot;god&quot;, and create a meme &quot;cult&quot; [[Armorsmith’s Followers|group]] with hundreds of autistic members, that is based on worshipping him. This group would build a lot of bases for Armorsmith, and the dedication of the members is so extreme, that some of them even built entire bases for him.

'''Armorsmith's Followers '''is a movement on 2b2t.org that recently declared itself as an independent group with the goal to worship Armorsmith, the group's leader and &quot;eternal god&quot;.

This movement is rensponsible for many autistic events throughout the server, and it's players are usually recognized as some of the server's greatest faggots.

Many players, including Armorsmith himself, don't take the movement too seriously.

Recently, the group begun expanding due to the AntVenom invasion, and apparently an anti-incursion movement. It brought FPS lagging to 2b2t, built a few bases and started their new propagnda project, in which they spam the reddit and chat.

== Old History ==
Armorsmith is known for lagging the server and performing autistic actions against the community. One day, he talked with a player named [[uglykids]] and suggested the idea of a group worshipping him. He wanted to call this faction &quot;The Soviet Reunion&quot;. Due to the lack of time, he couldn't create this faction. But he did design a symbol for it: A small hammer and sickle similar to the style of the [[VoCo]] vortex symbol.

Armorsmith would then use this symbol in every single base/ build he made, including Armorland end corner base, and his Carolina lag machine series.

A few months after he returned to Spawn, Armorsmith would team up with [[househousehouse1]] and P529 to create his third major lag machine and ruin Christmas. While building the lag machine, he decided that it was time to finally create a discord group of players who will worship him. He invited all kinds of players to the group. Both househousehouse1 and P529 were the co-leaders while Armorsmith led the entire project. househousehouse1 would quit later on.

Some of the elite members of the group, who showed their dedication, were trusted by Armorsmith. These players were invited to special group bases. A unique example of such a group base is 200 150. This base was constructed just less than 200 blocks away from 0,0 and it lasted for 4 months. It was built below a lava cast, and was griefed later on by the entire Spawn Mason. All of the players who worked on the base were from Armorsmith's Followers.

The group would also bring FPS lag machines to 2b2t. These lag machines were first built by a random players from a different server, and were spammed through Spawn thanks to Armorsmith and Sextinq.

The group decided to leave its mark at Spawn by building the Wrath of Armorsmith. IHackedWalmart would supply the builders with ender chests, while Metrez, Armorsmith and Pheanom worked on the Wrath. This became their new HQ. The wrath had blocks mined from the original Wrath outpost, since the group couldn't be bothered to go out and get their own obsidian. The movement recently became a group, but they still don't consider themselves to be a faction or a cult.

== Recent History ==
The group made an outpost on the April 1st map. The AntVenom was what made the group so large and unique. It brought hundreds of players to the group, making it one of the largest on 2b2t.

An agressive Armorsmith spam begun to take place. The group served as a nuisance during the 6th incursion while they were building their wall, and after the Fit video on that wall, they spammed withers on it. Armorsmith himself would make Fit combat log in one of their battles.

The group would also declare the independence of a new country on 2b2t with the name of Armorstate, giving their members a feeling of democracy. A president is being elected once every 6 months to run the group, however, his authorities are limited.

The group would create their own subreddit, merch shirts, social media accounts, a skin and other branches, such as the OG Names of 2b2t group run by Armorsmith and Caviyaz. The group is also known for griefing bases and being enemies of everyone on the server who it outside the group.

== Joining Policy ==
The group is very divided when it comes to ranks. Usually, a lot of players who join the discord are simply taking it as a meme and are not participating in building projects. Players can, however, rank up by posting their shirtless pictures in discord. New followers mainly focus on completing tasks, while the high ranked players are invited to group projects.

== Trivia ==
* There was once an old discord link that doesn't work anymore. This link, however, was advertised with withers at Spawn and you can still see this link and these withers to this very day. However, There is believed to remain at most 5 of these withers as they have been killed/renamed by the spawnfags and Lambo_Veneno
* The group was meant to be a parody of HeremticLock's Squiggles cult, where you build monuments to Armorsmith for rank ups. This however changed when HeremticLock quit the team.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1842">Asgard II was a base built by the remnants of [[Valkyria]], [[Legion of Shenandoah|the Legion]], and others (or the &quot;New Valkyrians&quot; if you don't have the time) during the Second Valkyrian Period. It was the next project after Fenrir and it was a base that had a population of 30 players.
[[File:Maxresdefault-1504739087.jpg|thumb|220x220px]]

== History ==
WIP

== Griefing ==
''&quot;There has never ever been closure on what happened at Asgard II&quot;''

- Fitler himself, July 25th, 2016

The griefing of Asgard II has been a convoluted and debated story. Many stories have been made speculating the destruction of Asgard II. Some people claim that [[OreMonger]] was responsible for the greifing due to an anonymous person with an alternate account leaking the coords, who was suspected to be a spy at the base, others believe that it was leaked by Sato due to internal struggles between James_Rustles, xarviar, Sato, and many other known kikes building at Asgard II, some believe their was an exploit used to find it, and many other stories of the like have been told. Controversial as the greifing is, the news of the public leak caused the residents to panic, some fleeing, others blowing up parts of the base so that no one could claim to have destroyed the base.   

After the grief however, the members became angered at the destruction and the third incursion began on April 29th, of 2015, two years after the founding of Valkyria, and lasted through the whole month of May, in revenge for the destroyed base. After the Incursion, Valkyria eventually began to dissolve and eventually disbanded.

== Trivia ==
* Players have continued the tradition of pre-destruction of bases after the fall of Asgard II in order to prevent claims of destruction.

'''''Astral Order believes in fostering a community of friends focused on build projects and adventuring. While most groups on 2b2t focus on memes, hoard treasure, or the conquest of the proverbial crown of the server, the Astral Order principally focuses on friendship, encourages respect for all, and welcomes those who seek a genuine community on 2b2t.''' -''the opening passage of the Astral Constitution

'''''ASTRAL HISTORY'''''

For as peaceful as the Astral Order may appear, it is steeped in a rich history of internal conflict and betrayal.

''Pre-unification''

Before the existence of the Astral Order, three independent fledgling groups existed on the server. These groups were the Church of Eden, the Ardent Shield, and the Knights of Spawn. The Church of Eden was a theocratic group of no more than three people as a cult of Adam and the World Serpent. The Ardent Shield, as a pair of two friends who believed in establishing peace on 2b, and the Knights of Spawn, the guardians against griefers now reduced to a single member since their destruction by the hands of Emperium. With their low member count, each organization banded together under the banner of the Church of Eden.

''The Church Period''

The Church began with few members, but with the prospect of building and exploration, membership rose to approximately 10. The burgeoning Church began plans to create an extravagant cathedral with unrealistic expectations for size and media. Meanwhile, members of the Church migrated to three locations which include Constantinople, Malachor, an undisclosed location in the negative quadrants, and spawn. Constantinople was griefed within weeks, which led the group to aimlessly wander until they returned to spawn to bolster their numbers. The spawn interlude successfully increased member count, though some individuals presented with questionable character. The constant movement left many members discouraged. In addition, the Church under SuperViperMan lacked a coherent ranking system. Consequently, the excitement of Church members dwindled and group functioning began to degrade into chaos. This caused concern among the higher ranking members, most notably FreefieldWarrior, Giganox, jay_monroe, and LordGalvatronMC regarding the future of Eden. Tensions between jay_monroe and SuperViperMan heightened as decisions regarding salvation of the the group came to the fore. During this time, jay_monroe in conjunction with LordGalvatronMC commanded loyalty among Eden members. This led to the Purge of Eden in which the majority of Eden members left the group within minutes with the direction of jay_monroe into a new discord owned by LordGalvatronMC. Defeated, SuperViperMan begrudgingly accepted a position among the high ranking members in the new group.

''The Transition Period''

The construction of the temple of Malachor marked the beginning of the emerging Astral Order. Subsequently after the Purge of Eden, the Astral Order (then known as Ordo Aurora) established a council system with seven seats. This system was created to improve fairness, foster unity, and to produce achievable goals. This method was successful; however, Fronk the Human and SuperViperMan began to bicker between each other and with other members. Emotions flared with neither side willing to concede to the other. Member activity began to decline and people began to spread across the map without participation in main group activities. Fronk the Human had become increasingly belligerent and hostile toward criticism, and demanded positions of power within the UGE and other liberties not granted to him without council approval. Out of spite for failing to receive what he wanted, Fronk the Human leaked coords to Malachor. Within hours, the temple had fallen to asunder with the few remaining unlit tnt blocks among the rubble and lavacasts. On a few signs read the names Armorsmith, Retronaut, and IHackedWalmart. Coming to his senses, Fronk the Human realized the ramifications of his actions. He was stripped of his noble title and banished from the Order. Within days, it is said he had nothing but a steel sword in his posession. .LordGalvatronMC, SuperViperMan, and jay_monroe mourned for the loss of the temple, and cleared what was left to let the temple not as a griefed base, but as a memory of what was.

''The Monastery Interlude''

Outraged at the sheer inactivity of members, jay_monroe with LordGalvatronMC, SuperViperMan, and FreefieldWarrior founded a new community high above the earth known as the Monastery. jay_monroe called upon all Astral members to attend or fear reprecusions. Though forceful, this successfully increaesd member activity and successfully increased members by a few. However, with time, members began to participate in their individual intersts again and forgetting about the Monastery. problems continued to plague Astral.

''The Astral Order Period''

Tired of their lack of unity as a group, jay_monroe obtained popular support from the majority of council members and Celestium to assume the mantle of Astral Lord which allowed him to tell players where to go and to provide a general outline for group goals which all members are required to follow. After he seized power, he ordered members to a new settlement closer to spawn dubbed Lugdunum. This decree increased member count and continued to foster a renovation of the Order. Soon, the Order's size had ballooned with the creation of new responsibilities for Meteorites and settlements were constructed throughout spawn. Wealth increased by at least three fold with the discovery of a duped stash. Due to timezone differences, preoccupation with real life, and the sheer number of members, jay_monroe decided to abdicate his position as Astral Lord in hopes that the Council would be able to unite the Order independently. With the council in tact, and the most deleterious members gone, Astral has gained in strength and numbers. Astral currently inhabits several location which includes their main base Lugdunum, Exitium, and Eagle's Rock. Uninhabited but in tact bases which Astral claims include Ardent Stronghold, and the Monastery.

'''ORGANIZATION'''

The Astral Order can be described as a meritocracy due to the emphasis on productivity and group involvement to ascend ranks. The exception is the Astral Council which is unobtainable for any members. The ranking system will be described in detail below:

''Astral Council''

The Astral Council is the main legislative and executive body of the Order consisting of seven members which come to a consensus majority vote to rule on internal group decisions. Their main responsibility is to mange members, work on major builds, and to build inter-group relationships.

''Celestium''

Celestia's (plural) are the rank-and-file of the Astral Order. Celestia assist Council members in projects and as advisers, but may also create their own Astral projects. A sub-rank of Celestium is the Celestial Emissary which is a special appointment created by the Astral Council. Celestial Emissaries take special responsibilities which may include settling of a Celestium base, resource allocation, and managing other Celestium and Meteorites on projects. Celestium may vote in the case there for some reason there is a tied vote in Council.

''Meteorites''

Meteorites are individuals who have passed the initial trial to enter the Astral Order and are continuing to undergo trials to determine their eligibility to become full-fledged members. They may be described as 'fledgling members' of the Order since they have few responsibilities and may leave before they become true Celestia. Their responsibilities include establishment of Meteorite bases, Crater bases, and Astral Shrines.

Aureus City was made over a year before [[the Rusher War]], started on May 31st, 2015. The base was founded by [[Caines_Law|CainesLaw]] and [[Tachrev]] and was the largest base of 2016. It was home to many midfags including [[Fit]], [[James_Rustles]], [[SnackyNorph]], and 12 others. Aureus City was also known as the City of Gold due to the massive gold farm they had. The gold farm produced so much gold that they started decorating the city with gold.

Near Aureus was a temple which housed a barrier block.

== History ==
Sometime during early 2015, CainesLaw and Tachrev's base, Exodus, was griefed. This left the two homeless until they joined the [[Valkyria|Valkyrians]] at [[Asgard II]]. When Asgard II was griefed, the CainesLaw and Tachrev joined the rest of the Valkyrians in [[the Third Incursion]]. After the Incursion, the two needed a home and so Aureus City was founded. They eventually began to slowly invite other players to the base, many being their former Valkyrian comrades. Them and their new base members had planned for the city to be the greatest city in 2b2t history. The gold farm was built by Caines_Law, in which it produced tons of gold. This allowed for the members to create large amounts of golden apples before they were removed in the 1.9 update. Tachrev and Caines_Law allowed their residents to build their own houses which were all built to the player's desire.

== Architecture ==
The base had beautifully decorated streets that led to several parts of the city. The streets were lined with gold from the massive amounts of gold produce from the gold farm. The base also had a lot of decorative helixes around the base. On the streets of Aureus, there were several custom and unique homes built by each player. In the underground areas, the mines were decorated with large lava pillars surrounded by gold and the sea parts of base had large glass domes and entrances. The base, while not the largest redstone base, had a lot of redstone contraptions such as automated farms, sorters, and lights that would tell the players how full the chests were. The contraptions were mainly built by [[Yellowstonejoe]] and CainesLaw, who both had redstone experience. The base also had the original shelter of Tachrev and CainesLaw, which was a small cave dug out with an enchantment table, several chests, beds, crafting tables, furnaces, and an anvil. There was a Jack-O-Lantern from Halloween and an artificial island created to keep mooshrooms in by Monkey.

== Impressive builds ==
=== CainesLaw's Gold Farm ===
A large farm with plenty of massive nether portals and rails, where you could become AFK for hours. There would also be a room under it, for all of the gold drops and nugget/ingot conversion.
=== Tachrev's Red Sandstone Wall ===
Tachrev created a wall mainly out of red sandstone and gold. Walkways to multiple builds such as Monkey's Treehosue and the Aureus Wizard Tower were paved with polished andesite and granite. Netherrack on fire also dotted the wall.
=== Spartan512's Pony Builds ===
Spartan512's builds in the city range from buildings to pixel or even map art. Most of Spartan512's pony pixel art is located in a part of the savannah known as Pony Valley. Included here is a map of Rainbow Dash and other pixel art. Spartan512 also created a library which is probably based on Twilight Sparkle's library in the show.
=== Aureus Wizard Tower ===
A tower that is mostly empty, overlooking the guardian farm. The top floor looks like a Jack-O-Lantern if you zoom out.
=== Hayor's Cathedral ===
The cathedral was never completed, but what had been built was already quite beautiful. It likely would have been completed long ago if the city's coordinates were never leaked. Plenty of resources were gathered and space was cleared in preparation for the build.
=== AwesomeGuyMonkey (and Jacktherippa)'s Treehouse ===
A very large treehouse modeled after a jungle tree. There are plenty of places to climb around, and the inside of the trunk has a slime block trampoline. There was also a very complicated branch system. On top of the tree's leaves was a small hut made by Jacktherippa, which was quite simplistic, made mainly of leaves. Under the house is a room made for brewing potions.
=== Mines of Aureus ===
The mines contained some underground farms, such as Fit's pumpkin pie farm, and a tree farm made by Caines_Law. CainesLaw also created a sorting system, with plenty of redstone wiring and lights that indicate how full the chests are. The end of the mines had some lava pillars being poured into gold containers, as well as a map of the whole base.
=== James_Rustles' colosseum ===
A massive, circular build with many water source blocks and catwalks made of wood planks inside. The arena was mainly made out of grass blocks. However, no fights were ever held here.
=== Fit's Museum ===
A museum made by Fit, with a gallery of map art, book collection and much more. Jacktherippa's head was actually obtained here. The museum was supposedly packed up rather than griefed with the rest of the base. It was also the primary target of the griefers of the base.
=== CainesLaw's Castle HQ ===
A confusing stone brick build full of hallways, with each room having a purpose. This was where everyone slept when they first arrived at Aureus. Two large helixes surround it.
=== CainesLaw's Iron Farm ===
Although the gold farm in the city was much more famous, the iron farm was just as efficient. It had a small house in the middle where you had to stand to get every part of the farm working at once, and iron ingots were collected here.
=== YellowstoneJoe's Ranch ===
A ranch built by YellowstoneJoe, with many automatic farms, such as automatic crops, pumpkins, sugar canes and more. They were automated in the same place due to YellowstoneJoe also building a villager trading hall beneath the ranch, where every single villager was kept, even ones that had been removed. They were automated in the same place so that you could trade crops with villagers for free emeralds. YellowstoneJoe also had a house here, and animal pens that seperated horses by speed.
=== Guardian Farm ===
A prismarine platform where guardians would spawn, as it was a former ocean monument. When the server updated, the build was corrupted and half the monument regenerated.
=== Mob Farm ===
There was also an advanced mob farm where even endermen would spawn. Most hostile mobs spawned here and it was an efficient system, like the rest of Aureus.
=== Fit's Radio Tower ===
A large tower that goes to maximum build height, and the highest point of the city. Overlooking YellowstoneJoe's ranch, the large structure was originally created to launch airships off of, but was later extended to maximum build height and ended up being used more for practice with elytra. You can fly around the whole base without firework rockets by jumping off the tower with elytra equipped.
== Griefing ==
While it may be unknown how Aureus's coordinates got leaked, the most accepted story is that [[SnackyNorph]] gave the rough coords to [[CancerChan]], who acted like Snacky's online girlfriend, despite being a boy, who discovered even closer coords by poking information out of Caines_Law who panicked when Cancer guessed very close coordinates. CancerChan then leaked them to [[CorruptedUnicorn]] and Benito_Tortelini who made the coords public. There is also another story that the coordinated were taken from a Skype conversation between members of the city. Fit then decided to grief the city along with many other formal Aureus members, like CainesLaw, Hayor, and YellowstoneJoe, as to take away any pleasure from coming griefers. Fit and several of the other members did not want to do this but the base was inevitably going to get griefed either way.

AutismBot is a bot created by Slappnbadkids. He often spams dark, racist or otherwise offensive jokes in chat. This bot is often running while he is playing on the account. He also posesses commands that players can use.

!insult &lt;playername&gt; will create an insult directed at the player name given.

!askautism &lt;yes/no question&gt; works similarly to [[BibleBot]]'s !askgod command, and will generate a usually insulting answer from AutismBot.

!suicidetips will give an autistic suicide tip.

!advice will give out an extremely unhelpful piece of advice on how to play 2b2t.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2421">Avalon City, also known as the City of Peace, [http://www.jamesrustles.com/2015/05/guest-post-avalon-city-of-peace-part-1.html was a base founded by AwesomeGuyMonkey]. The base has several parts and each one is connected by railroad. The base also included a zoo, an airport where players could fly airships off of, villager &quot;hotels&quot; where players could trade with villagers, boat harbours and several farms.

== History ==
[[File:2b2t 1.png|thumb|220x220px|AwesomeGuyMonkey, the founder of Avalon, standing outside of Avalon Castle]]
Avalon City was founded sometime in 2013 during the [[Spawn Incursions|Third Incursion]] . It was started when AwesomeGuyMonkey decided to leave spawn and create a city that would be a place of rest for travellers. The base's name is a reference to Avalon, the place where Excalibur was forged and King Arthur healed from his wounds, in order to show the intention that the base was for travellers to stock up on food and gear, heal, and rest. Players were allowed to enter this refuge if they came in peace and left hate and violence at the door.

=== Griefing ===
Because Avalon was located on an axis highway, griefing was an issue. In 2015, the [[-Z Axis Highway]] in the Nether had been extended to -125,000 (-1 Million Overworld) meaning access to Avalon was easy. Avalon was first majorly griefed in December 2015, with continuous minor griefings happening over time.

=== The Rusher War ===
During [[The Rusher War]] it was [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j_ox3bZnLw griefed by YouTuber BenMascott] as he believed it was a [[Team Veteran|Veteran]] base and must be destroyed because of his allegiance to [[Team Rusher]]. It was [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifqFakDLTYY restored a day later by two other YouTubers Target3DGaming] and TheJadyha. Since then Avalon has been destroyed, repaired and restored numerous times by various players.

== AwesomeGuyMonkey's Story ==
AwesomeGuyMonkey made a series of guest posts on [[James Rustles|James_Rustle]]'s 2b2t blog, detailing the history of Avalon, its construction &amp; its inhabitants. You can read them using the links below.

== History ==

Block Game Mecca was founded Jan 1 2017 by AutismBot and GanjMeisterBlock. They had all recently been at a build with c4rtm4n, which lasted two weeks because he invited too many people.

&quot;Block Game Mecca started with humble beginnings. It was nearly 6 months before anything resembling a decent base took shape. We started with the guardian farm area, but the first major build to be completed was the red spikey thing near the gold farm

We had a large concentration of redstoners, so we had every possible farm we needed in short order, and the members started building random things. Macca started on his tree, Ganj started on his hardhat recreations, dragon, and Prison Island

Vertrix eventually showed up to the base. He was the face of nearly everything with a rustic asthetic.

Myself and juicy primarily built the outside of the cathedral, but nearly every basemate had a hand in that. Vertrix did the entire interior by himself

Joey

Joey_coconut built the brick biome and worked on his village.

Ganj built the creeper farm

BerkBrein and myself did the guardian farm.

Mothra did a lot of the terraforming around the cathedral

the hitler statue was conceptualized by fr1kin, and brought to life by Nations, a non base member. We all worked on the project and got it done nearly overnight, but the carpet we dragged ass on and took a very long time.&quot;  

Macca did the pathways

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1899">Babbaj is a notable midfag on 2b2t. His name is not related to Jeff Dunham or any of his ventriloquist dummies, (stop spreading this meme around). 

== History ==

=== Early History ===
Babbaj, or also known as 'Babbajude' is a midfag that gained some respect among relevant oldfags. He joined in late summer of 2015, or as late as September 2015. Before the Rusher Era, he wasn't particularly known for anything in particular besides following around oldfags, and doing stuff in the end (such as building an enderman farming base that was later found and &quot;&quot;&quot;griefed&quot;&quot;&quot; by [[TheCampingRusher]]. It was not until June 2016 with the appearance of TheCampingRusher and his fans, and his appearances in Fit's videos, that he gained a reputation.

=== Rusher and Post-Rusher ===
Babbaj worked as a general for [[Team Veteran]] alongside [[Fit]] and aided in several large-scale Rusher massacres and raids on enemy strongholds. During the war, he became quite infamous as he was one of the first players to actually use End Crystals in combat and gave them out to noobs at spawn for the[[ Veteran Bounty List.]]

After the war, Babbaj moved on to work a lot with [[the 4th Reich]] and had several skirmishes with[[ Team Aurora]] members and griefed several bases.

== Role on the Server ==
Babbaj is a really active player, and can usually be found on the server almost every day. Babbaj can also be found in almost every 2b2t related Discord server. He has also become somewhat of a meme due to his tendency to immediately ignore people who annoy him.

Babbaj is also incredibly dangerous as he was one the the first players to use End Crystals as a weapon and also has them ready to fight. He is also a fast traveler, as he is usually one of the first players to grief a newly leaked place (This can be seen in the [[Don Fuer]] tour video).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3442">Backdoors are events on 2b2t when a player, or a group of players, bypass 2b's normal operations to gain access to exploits in which the particular players can abuse. Currently, there have been three major backdoors in 2b's history and all of them have been patched by [[Hause Master|Hausemaster]].

== First Backdoor (Popbob's Reign of Terror) ==
The first major backdoor of 2b2t, also known as the Dark Times and [[Popbob]]'s Reign of Terror, has had two intervals. The first interval of the backdoor began sometime in December of 2011 and ended in January of 2012. This is when the notorious [[popbob]] became one of the most feared players on the server due to his iconic thunder hack. The thunder hack operated as a sort of tracking device that tracked where lightning would strike. The mechanic of lightning in minecraft only works around chunks that are being loaded by players. By tracking the lightning, [[popbob]] essentially was able to track players in a span of months, weeks, or even days and found and destroyed several bases. Popbob, during this first interval of the backdoor, also had access to creative mode, in which he gave to many of his fellow facepunchers, including xcc2, policemike55, and others. This access to creative mode and the backdoor allowed for the creation of [[Ziggy Town|Ziggy Town's]] bedrock comet and [[Plugin Town]]. Hause eventually ended this backdoor interval by removing Popbob's access to some of his powers and creative mode. 

Despite the first interval ending, popbob continuously found new exploits and still had access to his thunderhack, which brought about the second interval that lasted from January, 2012, to May, 2013. Popbob also made himself invincible with his backdoor powers, allowing him to kill any player he encountered. Accounts have stated that popbob's sword swing was so fast, that you could barely see his arm or sword. Popbob also used his backdoor access to create [[Hacked Items|hacked items]]. Eventually the backdoor was patched by Hausemaster, disabling thunder from 2b2t for more than five years in the process. Popbob eventually took a break from 2b when he logged against [[Spawn Incursions #Third Incursion|Third Incursion]] members.

== Second Backdoor (The Arms Race) ==
The second major backdoor of 2b2t occurred during December of 2013. The backdoor involved [[iTristan]] and [[Pyrobyte]] in which they used their excessive knowledge of Java to create a plugin. They used this backdoor plugin to spawn in several [[Hacked Items|hacked items]] such as player heads and the infamous 32K weapons, which started [[the Arms Race]]. They also used it to get to the world border.

== Third Backdoor (The Hacked Account Crisis) ==
The third major backdoor was probably the most severe backdoor to this date and occurred sometime during the end of 2015 and ended in April, 2016. The backdoor involved the hacking of [[Georgebush420|georgebush420's]] OP (operator, but hell, can be called overpowered) account and the use of the /a exploit in which allowed players to triangulate people’s coords, causing the destruction of several bases. The [[Backdoor Crew|group]] involved used the account to grief bases, create more [[Hacked Items|hacked items]], and duplicate their 32K weapons. The backdoor was patched when Hause and George gained the account back.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2217">A barrier can be obtained in Minecraft by typing -

''/give (player name / command target code) barrier (amount)''

For example -

''/give Steve barrier 64 ''or ''/give @p barrier 64''

This requires cheats to be enabled and the player who is using the command to be OP'ed.

You would assume that only [[Hausemaster]] could spawn in a barrier block and he would never do so as barriers are unbreakable and restrict players, eg imagine if he surrounded an area with barriers so no one could get in that would not be anarchy.

But imagine if a certain player ''cough'' [[iTristan]] ''cough'' was to obtain OP by means of guessing the password of [[georgebush420]] and spawning in all manner of game-breaking items. And what if a certain player ''cough'' [[jared2013]] ''cough ''was to find one of those blocks and then proceeded to dupe those items. What would happen then?

I'll tell you what happens... GODDAMN HAUSEMASTER WILL INSTALL A DARN PLUGIN TO DISABLE THOSE ITEMS!!! Yes, your old friend Hause installed the &quot;[[disable item]]&quot; plugin. Basically if you look into any item container that contains one of the banned items (bedrock, barriers and pig spawners) it will be deleted instantly. If you try to place a banned block... BOOM it's gone.

These banned blocks can only be stored in your hotbar (if you look at your inventory it's gone), or in a zombie's hand. They cannot be placed either. C'mon [[popbob]], [[pyrobyte]]... [[Kinorama]]? Can you guys disable this plugin? Oh wait all the 2b2t hackers are gone... We only have [[Lagfags]] left. DAMN YOU RUSHER!

== Trivia ==
* A barrier block can be found at the ruins of [[Aureus City]]
* Barrier blocks are completely transparent unless one is held in the player's hand.
* Barrier blocks have a blast resistance of 18,000,003 and a hardness of -1 making it effectively unbreakable without creative mode or mods.
* A barrier block was briefly found at 234,79,7820 between the dates 21/11/16 and 15/12/16 (British format) It is assumed that Hause removed it for balance reasons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3111">== Bedrock ==

Bedrock is one of the most common blocks in the game, however, bedrock that was not generated naturally is considerably rarer. However, it can be found at many places on the map, and is used by those few players who manage to obtain it for its extreme rarity and hardiness. Bedrock cannot be legitimately obtained in survival mode, and can only acquired through the use of exploits, or obtaining the password of an OP account (i.e, [[georgebush420]]). It is listed as a banned block by the &quot;disable block&quot; plugin, so is now extremely hard to store or use.

Examples include the [[Ziggy Town|Ziggytown]] bedrock comet, a structure built to resemble a dead space beacon, which remained completely unaltered for many years (and had a wither trapped inside it for several of those years) until it was recently broken open by the &quot;2b2t police&quot;. Other examples of artificially placed bedrock include the single piece of bedrock at [[Space Valkyria]] and the bedrock... male reproductive organ (otherwise known as a penis) near [[Point Nemo]].

In addition, naturally placed bedrock has been broken many times by many players in the past. One method of breaking bedrock involves deleting it by making a dragon egg teleport to the block space occupied by a bedrock block. Until dragon eggs were removed by Hausemaster, there was an extremely large amount of dragon eggs in circulation on the server, meaning most players could use this exploit if they knew how to do it. Hausemaster installed a plugin to remove holes in the bottom bedrock layer after players started using elytra hacks to fly through the nether underneath the bottom bedrock layer, going in and out of holes in it, in order to travel across the server extremely fast (you could travel millions of blocks in just a few hours) and lag the server excessively (a lot of chunks were loaded by players who did this).


[[File:JXs0H4z.jpg|thumb|315x315px]]

The very idea of an unbreakable block defies an anarchy server, as the player is limited by it. This, of course, is what has prompted many players over the years to defy the inherent challenge bedrock poses. This is why Hause is so strict about banned blocks (imagine if a bedrock cube was built in the 1000 block radius of spawn. It would restrict any newfriends from joining and slowly starve the server of players).

== Trivia ==
* Bedrock has a blast resistance of 18,000,000 and a hardness of -1 making it unbreakable on vanilla survival mode (unless you manage to cram millions of lit TNT entities into just a few block spaces surrounding a piece of bedrock)
* Exploits like the Dragon Egg/Chunk Lag exploit allow players to &quot;delete&quot; a block of bedrock.
* Hausemaster often breaks illegally placed bedrock for obvious reasons.
* A plugin was recently installed which automatically repairs bedrock at the Overworld floor and Nether floor and ceiling. This stopped players using the Elytra+ hack to travel large distances and load excessive amounts of chunks.
* If somehow destroyed, bedrock doesn't drop anything.

BibleBot is a chatbot created by 0x22, powered by python. BibleBot is named for its constant references to Christianity, the bible, and christian morals. BibleBot comes with a variety of commands players can use.

!verse - allows the player to pick a verse from the Bible for BibleBot to read.

!execute - players type in the name of a certain player and BibleBot will start a vote to execute the player for a randomly chosen reason. it is not advised to &quot;vote&quot; because inorder to vote, player must do /kill yes or /kill no

!help - list all available commands

!joinmessage - this command lets players type in a message assigned to a players name. When that specific player comes online,BibleBot says the message in the chat. This is BibleBot's most iconic command. Note that players cannot set their own join messages

!joke - this command will make BibleBot tell a rather cheesy Biblical themed joke.

!askgod - this command has players ask a question to god,where god will then answer back with yes, no, or maybe

!report - allows players to &quot;report&quot; people to &quot;the moderators&quot; of 2b2t. When doing so, BibleBot will respond with '[Player Name], thanks for the report. A moderator will assist you shortly.' Of course there are no moderators on 2b2t and this command is entirely a joke. 
== Trivia ==

* BibleBot is one of the oldest chatbots on 2b2t, having existed since mid-to-late 2015. ([https://youtu.be/82WcLyrvP5I?t=35s Proof here])
* BibleBot will announce where it spawns if it is killed.
* BibleBot will greet new players by saying &quot;Welcome [Player] To 2b2t,a peaceful queuing simulator&quot; unless someone set a joinmessage for the player.
* During October of 2016, BibleBot changed its theme from Christianity to Haramabe. This was only temporary.
* After [[kinorana]] [[Kinorana Map Crisis|erased map data]] in February 2017, BibleBot greeted new players with &quot;Welcome [Player] to 2b2t, a peaceful cartography server. To get started simply ask 'Hause, where are the maps?'&quot;
* In the lead up to the 2017 British Election, BibleBot became a Jeremy Corbyn worshipping bot based around 'Momentum Activists'
* BibleBot is very easy to exploit. One of the most common way to do so is to type !execute (60 random letters). This will get BibleBot kicked out of the server for spam. This was briefly patched in February but it broke again after April Fools. Video[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CN0PIcO6Gxc]

'''The Brotherhood''' '''of Diamonds '''is one of the oldest groups of 2b2t. It was described in Judge Holden’s comic and it also had known activities around spawn, recruiting members there and providing them with diamonds. 

== History ==
The Brotherhood was founded by players known as MasterV, Urue_101, and Flamereaper666. It began when V discovered an abandoned base along the negative X highway. He and his two friends decided to rebuild the base and they found a diary titled &quot;Caveman's Log&quot; within the base, who was assumed to be the original owner. Eventually, the three got the aid of Sleeprocket and an unknown player whose player name had B in it to rebuild the base. After Urue fell into lava in the Nether, MasterV collected his gear but was attacked by an infamous nether killer known as LovesTwoSplodge. Master successfully managed to barely escape Splodge and from then on the group decided to form the brotherhood. 

The group had large plans, one of their largest was to fix and terraform spawn. The group, at one point, helped xcc2 and 0XP0 defend their base from a raider group known as [[The Vikings|the Vikings/Dutch]] and successfully warded off the attackers. 

The Brotherhood eventually made itself more noticed amongst the 2b2t community and was infamous for collecting diamonds, and they gave all new players who came across their spawn bases as many diamonds as they wanted. Because of this, the group became famous among new players and continued to be a remembered group, even today. 

The Brotherhood however suffered several base sabotages, making the group disband over time. There is little information about them since all the members left years ago. 

== Relations ==
* Facepunch Republics - Most likely were friendly towards each other as the Brotherhood aided players at spawn.
* 4channers - Most likely friendly for the same reason as the Facepunchers.
* Vikings/Dutch - Enemies as the two fought each other in a battle for xcc2's and 0XP0's base.
* Fellowship of the Diamond - Neutral (No relations)
* THEJudge's group - Most likely friendly as the two did similar things like recruiting and helping players at spawn. Judge Holden also included the group in his comics.

== Notable Members ==
* MasterV (Founder)
* Urue_101 (Founder)
* Flamereaper666 (Founder)
* Sleeprocket (Founder)
* &quot;B&quot; (Full IGN unknown) (Founder)
* Arcandi
* Mestarit

== Trivia ==
* Coincidentally enough, around the same time, another group known as the Fellowship of the Diamond formed.
* Since the two groups were lost to time and information was forgotten, the Brotherhood was credited to have done things that the Fellowship did despite the two being completely different groups and having nothing to do with each other.
* The Brotherhood was more active and made their presence more noticeable than the Fellowship did which contributed to the player confusion.

== FancyTown ==
FancyTown (or Ocala City) is a base being built solo by Lifeisgood72. It's a model city featuring Paris, London, and Berlin sections and styles of architecture. It was founded June 17, 2017.
In early July 2018, Lifeisgood72 founding the &quot;Ocalean Empire&quot; in which he posted on reddit, saying that the Empire controlled an amount of the map and would build various cities. Lifeisgood72 stated that the capital is outside the Empire. However, this wasn't true. Ocala city is relatively close to spawn, and this is what helped its demise. 


Lifeisgood72 sent coordinates to _Courier6__ after two days of the two getting to know eachother. It was an act of betrayal and Lifeisgood72's gullibleness which caused the demise of the Ocalean Empire, and the destruction of the capital, Ocala City.

== The Order Of The Tower (Ireton) ==
On November 29th, 2016 Irevore started building a massive obsidian tower monument, reaching from bedrock to

{{2B2T_Group_Template|title1 = The Order Of The Tower|image1 = Banner-1528215452.png|approx_founding_date = November 29, 2016. Offical founding date - April 17, 2017|status = Active|#_of_members = 7}}
skylimit. After the 2017 April fools map, Irevore decided to invite 5 other people to help build the tower, mostly those that he had seen around [[Doctrzombie]]'s Fort Dick.

On April 10, 2017 ForgottenHarmony arrives with IvoireThePaladin on the way. Three days later, Crayfisher2012, Janne1204, and D0NTkillKENNY arrive and begin building their own sections of the base outside the main tower location.

On April 16, 2017, with the tower still under construction, the base members took a break and decided to build a lag machine that would bring the tps down to 5 or lower. They called it &quot;The Hexagon&quot; due to the hexagonal-shaped platforms it was constructed with. The original design was able to cut the TPS in half and with subsequent revisions meet the goal of bringing the TPS from 20 to 5 in a matter of minutes. This structure would become outdated and eventually become broken by design-tinkering and a server upgrade. It was then ultimately abandoned, status unknown.

On April 19, 2017 the base members were able to gain lots of materials from the donkey dupe, until it was patched on April 21, 2017.

On April 29th, 2017 Kraze7997 joined the base, on recommendation of ForgottenHarmony, bringing the final member count of the base to 7.[[File:78pcEKA.png|thumb|Inside Irevores wizard tower in Ireton|link=https://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/File:78pcEKA.png]]May 3rd, 2017 Crayfisher2017 built a cobble generator, able to churn out a stack of cobble every minute.

On May 17, 2017, with the tower nearly finished, The Town of Ire (Ireton) has begun construction, which will later turn into the hub of the tower.

May 29th, 2017, with the obsidian rings surrounding the tower all but cleared out from stone, a glass lava sphere on top of the tower has started being put together.

Somewhere around June 29, 2017, Crayfisher2012 and Forgottenharmony began their journey towards x+ 1 million, on an errand, to gain glitched items on a tip from IvoireThePaladin who was contacted by &quot;a guy&quot;. The items turned out to be old [[Hacked Items|Glitched Enchanted Books]].

The base's leader, Irevore, has since stopped playing 2b2t. Although still active every now and then with the team in their discord. The large black tower stands unfinished, looming over the towns in the distance, as a centerpiece. Although with Irevore being inactive, the base is still active; with ForgottenHarmony, Crayfisher2012, and the rest of the basemates logging in once and a while and working on their projects/finishing the tower. How long will the base last? Only time will tell.

Pictures of the base will be posted when the base is found/griefed.
== Oceania IV ==
'''The Story'''

Oceania was a [[:Category:Bases|base]] founded in early 2017 by 3 players by the names of Rayzo, Sreardon2020, and 6Mill, who were just looking for something to do. The base was abandoned for a handful of months before Rayzo and IHackedWalmart returned to it during late August of the same year, with plans of finishing it.

{{2B2T_Build_Template|image1 = 2017-09-01 17.33.00.png|status = Unknown. Possibly disbanded or griefed|approx_date_construction_began = Februrary 2017|approx_date_finished = Unknown|builder(s) = IHackedWalmart, Rayzo, Sreardon2020}}
'''The Construction'''

Oceania was created by making a large circle in the ocean, over the center of an old ocean monument. It was cut into hundreds of 5x5 sections spanning down 50 blocks to the bottom of the ocean. Oceania was then drained and mined out, leaving an empty hole where the proud ocean monument once stood.

'''What is It?'''

Oceania's main attraction is the gaping hole in the center, with the 6Mill memorial at the bottom of it. It also features several smaller holes around the center one, and ginormous obsidian statues of various ocean monsters, gods, and dragons. There are many more attractions planned for the base as time goes on.

== Celestia ==
Celestia was a base founded in late 2016 by [[RobMaster21]] . It lasted until late April, 2017, when it was insided and griefed by Parthicus and http_logan. The base at it's prime had 10 members:
*RobMaster21 (Leader)
*_Henry_
*ImmortalYogurt
*Diagoporotin
*Niftyrobo
*Mr8Wilschr
*Crazy_Queen_Lisa
*Chrissipo
*Fuffer

== End bases ==

=== Armorland ===
In August 2017 there was an exploit that allowed players to travel long distances in a short period of time using elytras. This exploit was mainly used to lag the server by loading a lot of chunks at the same time. However, this exploit was used by a few players to reach the world border very fast. Armorsmith would use this exploit to be the first player on 2b2t to reach the end world border corner, and he built a base at -30000000 -30000000 called Armorland, although a few players would reach it a few days after him.

== Early History ==
It is unknown when exactly Byrnsy first joined 2b2t. Although he may have played in 2011 or 2012 (using the name xxBurnseyxx) the earliest proof of his playing comes from early 2013. He has said that he first found out about 2b2t from a thread on 4chan's /v/ board.

Byrnsy was largely a solo player prior to 2016, only occasionally appearing at spawn or speaking in chat. Despite this, he did have a small part in the third incursion (usually consisting of being killed by the more active incursion players). Some time in late 2015, Byrnsy found a dupe stash containing full armor sets and several stacks of Notch Apples. This dupe stash gave Byrnsy the resources needed to fully participate in the Rusher War.

== The Rusher War ==
Because Byrnsy has armor and Notch Apples, he quickly started participating in the Rusher War activities in June of 2016. Most notably, he fought [[CorruptedUnicorn]]. After the first fight, Byrnsy gave Corrupted and his friend several God Apples as a sign of respect for a good fight. These apples would eventually be duped, giving power to the Resistance. Byrnsy would also participate in several other fights posted on Youtube, including a 2v2 with [[Torogadude]] against several Archon Youtubers and a rematch against CorruptedUnicorn.

Byrnsy eventually became involved with the main incursion group led by [[Sato86|Sato]] and [[Fit]], although he was not an active participant on many group raids or events. He did base with this group for a short time at [[Medina]] however.

== Directly Post-Rusher ==
Byrnsy returned to solo play in September of 2016, creating his Ocean Base as well as the Milhouse Map. While mapping the area around his base one day, he came across an underground path spanning thousands of blocks. This base led to [[Offtopia's Drain|The Drain]], which was an active base at the time. Rather than griefing the base, Byrnsy left some signs asking if he could build there. The group at The Drain agreed, and Byrnsy joined the base. The Drain was griefed soon after Byrnsy joined, but Byrnsy would remain involved with the group in several future smaller projects.

== Traveling to the +X Border ==
Eventually deciding he was bored with building, Byrnsy decided to try digging to the 2b2t world border via the +X netehr highway, which only went to 800k at the time. He left from spawn on December 9th, 2016. Starting at 175k, he made nether milestones every 25k. These milestones were often pretty simple, each having a portal, a unique theme, and areas for players to place signs. After every 10% of the journey, he would post albums containing screenshots and captions to the 2b2t subreddit.

These posts inadvertently started a movement that saw many players make the trek to head to the world border. The first players to reach where Byrnsy was on the highway were Pufferfluffs and Auion. These three players started the first major +X highway dig base, known as [[Outpost Oasis]]. As time went on, more people joined the dig. These players, now calling themselves [[ Nether Highway Group|The Nether Highway Group]], made bases at [[15 Million Town|15million overworld]] and 3 million nether. This group eventually reached the +X border, founding [[Point Nemo]] and [[Point Dory]]. After Dory, the group started a new highway, this time to the +X +Z corner, which was eventually reached. Although the group disbanded at this point, Byrnsy remains at the corner, working on a solo base that he has not yet revealed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1654">c1yd3i is an midfag who joined sometime in late 2014 during the tail end of the Valkyrian era. 
[[File:Photo-1495826519.jpg|thumb|220x220px|YouTube Profile Picture]]

== History ==
When he first joined with his friend Rustle_League, the two wanted to travel as far away from spawn as they could, until they got bored at least. Somewhere in the millions, c1yd3i and Rustle_League started construction of [[Kool Kids Klub|The Kool Kids Klub]] where they eventually started to invite new players to the base. Eventually, the base was griefed as it was very close to the highway. This lead to the former members to join [[Valkyria]] in which c1yd3i participated in the [[Spawn Incursions|Third Incursion]].

Awhile after [[Valkyria]] disbanded, c1yd3i griefed [[New Niggintow]]n and started to become a notorious griefer on the server. As he became  
[[File:C1yd3i.png|thumb|220x220px|Skin]]
more infamous, he began hanging out with notorious 2b2t players like [[iTristan]], C4RTMAN, and [[fr1kin]]. He later joined [[the Tyranny]].

During early 2016, he had a bit of an argument with James_Rustles due to him having a [[Hacked Clients|hacked client]] known as Vapid, in which it allows c1yd3i to discover player's coordinates. c1yd3i accused James_Rustles of stating that he was &quot;hacking&quot; people with complex Java scripts which made people's computers' vulnerable and running viruses on his web server, however James_Rustles denied this by saying that the only thing he said was that the client allowed him to gain coordinates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5645">{{Autism}}CancerChan is an infamous insider who was notorious for giving the coords to several bases. He joined the server two or three days after [[Rusher]] . During his travels on the -x highway in [[the Nether]] , he came upon an abandoned base. He was lucky enough to find a god armor set, a few stacks of diamonds, and food. This tricked several people into believing that he was an oldfag. When the oldfags were confused about who he was, they came to believe that CancerChan was an alternate of either cytotoxictcells or leasy, female oldfags who stopped playing on 2b2t. This is how the rumors began about him being a girl.
==Most Notorious Act==
His most notorious act was the cause of the destruction of[[ Aureus City]] . He went along with the rumors that he was a girl and was asked by the desperate loser [[SnackyNorph]] , a member at Aureus, to see &quot;proof&quot; of him being a girl (I'm pretty sure you can figure out what kind of &quot;proof&quot;). He actually proved it by sending pics of his ex-girlfriend (pretty fucked up if I do say so myself). Snacky then asked to base with Cancer and he said yes, becoming Snacky's &quot;internet girlfriend&quot;. Snacky eventually wanted to take Cancer to Aureus which caused [[Caines_Law |CainesLaw ]] and the other members to panic and told Snacky not to. Snacky, the idiot he was, ignored these panics as they began walking to Aureus anyways. Snacky was then disconnected by the server and, while technically not the exact coordinates, gave coords of Aureus to CancerChan. CancerChan then figured out the true coordinates by poking information out of Caines_Law (this is why [[Fit ]] stated that Cancer persistently asked for the coords in his video). He eventually guessed very close coordinates which caused CainesLaw to panic, in which Cancer knew it was where Aureus was. He eventually wanted to trade the coords of Aureus to several different players. At first, he was going to trade them with the infamous griefer taylo112 but the two had an argument which made them lose contact. He eventually gave the rough coords to [[CorruptedUnicorn ]] for an elytra and an enchanted stained glass. He also gave them to the player BenitoTortelini who found the exact coords and leaked them publicly. This lead Team Veteran to destroy Aureus City in order to prevent others from receiving the glory of griefing it.

According to Cancer, the reason he argued with Fit was basically to get more trust from Snacky, as Snacky hated Fit. This fake trust he made with Snacky was to get as much free gear as possible. Cancer has also stated that he never trusted Snacky as he was a very weird dude (as you can probably tell). Cancer has admitted to feeling a bit of regret about leaking the coords of Aureus as he didn't know what the enormity of the base was as Snacky did not really go into detail about the base except about Fit's museum and that CainesLaw lived there. He claims that Fit griefed the base without the permission of many of the formal members, who told him to wait it out. He claims the only reason Fit griefed the base was to make a video about it, however, this may be untrue as CainesLaw, Hayor, and [[YellowstoneJoe ]] have been seen in his video and they were all former members of Aureus (with CainesLaw being one of the founders). Fit has also believed for a while that Cancer was a women, despite him proving that he was a man.
==Rusher Spy==
After the events of Aureus City, CancerChan moved on to be Rusher's &quot;Veteran Spy&quot;. He gave several of his old base coords where he based with Snacky, which he called Veteran bases, to Rusher in order to gain his trust. Rusher made a video revealing that CancerChan was his spy and that he was actually a guy and not a girl. Fit made a video about this one and told Rusher that trusting CancerChan was his own funeral. Rusher heeded to Fit's warning and cut ties with Cancer. CancerChan's intentions with Rusher was to get revenge on SnackyNorph, who stole a small dupe stash from Cancer after the whole Aureus fiasco, by allowing Rusher to take from the bases Cancer showed him, which were actually Snacky's dupe stashes.

== New name ==
CancerChan's new In-Game name is FlaSh_420 from what some players say, and his Discord is known as &quot;Rub by wiggler&quot; &gt;= Rub My Wiggler#7721. Still as autistic as before.

==Team Aurora==
CancerChan's next victim was [[Team Aurora]] . During the waning days of [[the Rusher War]] , CancerChan began coming into contact with Team Aurora as he found their HQ. He showed his presence at the base when [[NedaT]] found a strange house built at their base. She then offered him a place in their ranks, in which he accepted, and had a full on interview with him, in which he explained the entire Aureus drama. CancerChan soon betrayed them by leaking the coords of Aurora base because Chloe2K15 stole a stack of gapples from him. He did this to get revenge against the Team, since they were laughing at him for making a big deal about a stack of gapples and CancerChan had a small skirmish with the group. CancerChan, along with his friend, Da99thWolf, began to partially grief their HQ. This caused Aurora to grief their own base, similar to how Team Veteran griefed Aureus City.
==Nightingale==

CancerChan and Da99thWolf went on to grief Nightingale (Brayin and Da99thWolf's first base on 2b2t) on September 26, 2016 (video posted on October 3).

== Peacekeepers ==
CancerChan and Da99thWolf were about to grief a Peacekeeper spawn base but was griefed already by the 4th Reich on October 17th, 2016.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4157">Shenandoah was a base founded by jesse_number6. The base was used by oldfags, middlefags, and newfags alike.{{Space_Valkyria|title1 = Castle of Shenandoah|built = ???|destroyed = ???|builder = Legion of Shenandoah|griefer = ??? (Anonam00se responsible for coord revelation)|dimension = Overworld}}
[[File:4 KePddAM.png|thumb|220x220px]]

== Early Days ==
At the very beginning, the base was nothing more than a few halls stacked on top of eachother, like an underground hotel. Many players had rooms at Shenandoah, and every now and again someone stopped by to resupply. E_to_the_G and Atrika were two notable players that had a home away from home here. E_to_the_G, or Eto, as he was commonly called, enjoyed fetching newfags out of spawn and testing them to see if they had what it took to come to Shenandoah. Two players that he brought from spawn who would change the server forever, were hjc711 and Germinaneu. hjc711 arrived at Shenandoah shortly after Germinaneu, and they became friends during the few times they got online at the same time. It was around this time that jesse_number6 would begin work on the Castle of Shenandoah.

== Inviting Other Players ==
Jesse was never able to play much, and left the castle as merely a facade. Eventually, Germinaneu left the server for a long time, leaving hjc711 to tend to the base by himself. During this period, hjc711 went to spawn with Eto to the base known as NFE. There, he met Pyrobyte, Jared2013, Saril2000, and a few other players. Unknown to them all, this would be the last day that NFE would remain intact, as the next day, it was withered and griefed by popbob. hjc711 brought saril2000 back to Shenandoah, and they began to expand the base, and begin completing the castle started by jesse_number6. Soon afterwards, Germinaneu returned on the new account bigbang105. This time, he was accompanied by his friend AppleLight. During this period, hjc and bigbang brought animals to the base, including horses and donkeys. The base began to rapidly expand as new members were invited to the base, and new builds were being created. Unfortunately, once again, bigbang105 disappeared, along with AppleLight. However, E_to_the_G invited hjc711 and saril2000 to Etobase, leaving Shenandoah unihabited. bigbang105 and AppleLight returned on the account EX0DlSS and GERMKILLA, and got in contact with hjc711, (who had changed his account name to _Henry_) inviting him back to their old base.
[[File:1 96rFhq0.png|thumb|220x220px]]

== Grief and Group Formation ==
The base was massive at this point, harboring many new players and buildings. The Castle was finally completed, marking the formation of the Legion of Shenandoah. The main members of the Legion were EX0DlSS, _Henry_, Sure_Iock, GERMKILLA, and Saril2000/JoshGreep. 2 new players living at Shenandoah, jacobigrat, and adh2000 got into a disagreement, that culminated in adh's room in the castle being griefed. _Henry_ and EX0DlSS stepped in to try and end the conflict, but ended up making it worse. jacobigrat and _Henry_ got into a heated fight in chat, which prompted observers to try and egg the two on into a PvP match. The two staged a fake duel which ended up with Jacob leaking false coords to Shenandoah. At this point, Anonam00se (a Team Sun member), pulled up the real coords which had always been public.(So technically not Jacob's fault). Soon after, the Legion went to a string of new bases, but were eventaully invited to Asgard II by Sato86. This event marked the union between the Valkyrians, who had been living at a base called Fenrir, and the Legion of Shenandoah.

== Rebuilding ==
During the [[Age of Hype]], jesse got together with [[Team Malaria]] and rebuilt Shenandoah. Everything was going smoothly until a Youtuber named Mines settled at the castle. The group was worried that the base would be found and destroyed by newfags. At the end of December 2016, the group invited 0xymoron to grief the base, ending Shenandoah's life forever. Turns out Malaria was threatening jesse to leak the coords.

Chaology is a player who joined 2b2t in 2015 with another account that he has long forgotten. He is usually known for putting signs around monuments, ruined houses and spawn. He plays with a small group of people, and with his friend [[DrZ0mbie|Z0mbie]] . 2b2t is his main server, and he won't quit unless something huge happens to him. He's anti-[[rusher]] and anti-[[voco]] and use to love the[[ facepunchers]] .

==History of Chaology==
Chaology joined 2b2t on a different account, he was just a newbie and didn't know what to do. The first build he made was a small shack in the swamp biome with an anvil inside of it. He later deleted 2b2t off his server list and forgot about it. It wasn't until late 2017 he came back to 2b2t, and meet his friend Z0mbie while playing 2b2t.

He now travels the plains, hundreds of thousands away from spawn, as he travels with his donkey, seeing areas full of seeds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6926">'''Note: The 2b2t wiki is NOT responsible for your usage of any Cheat client. You can possibly be banned on servers outside of 2b2t. Please use at your own risk.'''

Hacked Clients are clients made for Minecraft that offer cheats (known as hacks) for players that are not part of the Minecraft's vanilla game. No hacked client website or company is affiliated with Mojang, similar to most mods. On most servers, using hacked clients is a punishable offense and may get players banned (by either admins or [[Anti Cheat|Anti-Cheat]]) from the specific server, depending on server's policies and rules. They can give players unfair advantages over others in mini games or gamemodes for things like combat and basic movement. This leads to bad sportsmanship, cheating, and rendering the games less entertaining, with the exception of the hacker being the only one entertained.

== Pertaining to 2b2t ==
Since 2b2t is an anarchy server, which means almost nothing is off limits in terms of Minecraft, it allows for players to use these clients and are actually a part of everyday life on 2b. Since it is such a large part of regular day to day activity on the server, using clients are almost a must and not using one is essentially crazy. Any newfaga should keep this in mind, and should be open to the frame of thinking that all players are using a hacked client on a daily basis- because they probably are. In fact, players on 2b have even coded their own hacked clients.

Most hacks on hacked clients are acceptable for use on the server however certain hacks, such as speed and flight, have limits to their usage or otherwise don't work in order for the gameplay to be fair. This is so that players don't get instantly killed by others, fly like in creative mode, gain server operator status through forceop, generate thousands of chunks every minute etc..

== List of Used Clients on 2b2t ==

This section will discuss most of the used clients on [[2b2t]] and rank them based on their usage by the common player. Most of these are offered by [https://www.wizardhax.com/ Wizardhax.com] or the client's own personal site. Future has its own website but requires a login and purchase to get access to the client.

=== Common Clients ===
* [https://impactdevelopment.github.io/ Impact] - Made popular during the Rusher War after Rusher's advertisement and the eventual use of many 2b2t YouTubers. It is known to have the most useful hacks for 2b2t in free client, with features such as Entity Speed and AutoTotem.
* [https://www.futureclient.net/index.php Future] - Client advertised by Fit and several other 2b2t YouTubers. The Future client costs $20, and is one of the few clients that cost money. Some cracked versions might exist.
* [https://www.wurstclient.net/ Wurst] - Common client with several cosmetic hacks such as inventory see, (working) x-ray, and better tracers. This client is also widely known of outside of 2b2t as well as on the server.
=== Somewhat Common Clients ===
* Wolfram - Known for NCP bypassing features
* Aristois - Used commonly for its ChatSpammer feature. Has an $8 premium version and support for an alt dispenser.
* LiquidBounce - Used for a brief time due to a Bed Exploit.
* Matix
* Skill (yes this is an actual client name)
* Nodus - Was a commonly used client back in the day, very common outside of 2b2t due to being barely detectable.
* Asuna - maintained by Sasha.
* Xdolf - created by [[x0XP]]. Commonly distrusted due to obfuscations in the code and weird behaviour.

=== Custom Hacked Clients ===
* Helix - Client developed by Izverg86 and used by certain members of the Diggers.

* nhack - Client made by the [[Backdoor Crew]]
* Client reskins - First started by VoCo. Eventually used by soda factions.
* DonFuer client - roumored to having been used by the [[DonFuer]] , and to be a custom client with multiple exclusive cheats.
* Vapid - Client created by [[c1yd3i]]
* root - Developed by 086
* Kinodupe - Client that only existed for 6 whole days during the 11/11 dupe. Its only purpose was to make duping easier during the 11/11 dupe. However, using this client would leak your co-ords.
* Vort3x - Vortex Coalition client made by inv41idu53rn4m3 popular for spamming Did you know? messages and duping during the 11/11 dupe
* Glowclient - Client Created by GlowskiBroski, contains a working packetfly and some other unique hacks
* Future Gold - Codename for a custom client made by the future devs, it is private and is better than even the paid version of future

== Installing hacks into Minecraft ==
''This is a general installation guide for '''Windows''' and for WizardHax clients.''

'''&lt;u&gt;WARNING:&lt;/u&gt; If your computer knowledge goes as far as pressing radio buttons and pressing, &quot;Install,&quot; on the installation wizard, take extra precautions on installations or don't do it at all.'''

Step one - you must choose the desired hacked client as their are several clients that a player can choose from.

Step two - you need to download it and this is where it gets risky. The reason it is risky is because of downloading through the main website of the hack. If you download through the website, it will most likely take you through an ad.fly or a website of the same function(Coins for a click) that could spawn a pop-up that contains a virus or any other malicious entity that will make your antivirus protection freak out (or a scam ad that says you have one and to call a number, but still). Unless you have an Ad Block program '''(Still Risky),''' it is much safer to get a '''&lt;u&gt;MEDIAFIRE (NO OTHER WEBSITE) &lt;/u&gt;'''link from a '''&lt;u&gt;TRUSTED PERSON.&lt;/u&gt;''' Do not, under any circumstances, open download links, let alone links in general, that were posted by someone in chat.

Step three - you must have a zip file opener. Programs like 7zip and WinOpener are sufficient to unzip the client files. Not suggested to get WinRAR as it is not free (the first two are completely safe. Heck, one of them is from Windows itself.).

Step four - once you unzipped the file, go to the .minecraft folder in the %appdata% folder and transfer whatever is inside the unzipped folder into the versions folder.

Step five - once you have done step four, open up your Minecraft launcher and make a new profile. Depending on the client, it may require to be named a specific name: i.e. 313hax (Impact)). Now simply change the Minecraft version to the one with the hacked client name next to it and you're good to go.

Worst comes to worst, you can always look up how to download clients through youtube tutorials. '''Make sure you do not watch any tutorials from the WizardHax channel as it will lead you through the websites that have the malicious entities. Note however, that it is only the ad.fly links of which are malicious. It may be beneficial to use an antivirus in all usage and downloads.'''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5232">Chezhead was the founder and President (leader) of the [[Facepunch Republic]] . Chezhead was, undoubtedly, one of the most influential players that ever played on 2b2t, and his legacy continues in almost every cooperative base that you see on 2b today. Chezhead invisioned a peaceful and cooperative anarchy server and, despite his initiate failing horribly, players continue to be cooperative in the ruthless server.

This will be added soon, made this page in order to put authentic posts lol.

This was retrieved by [[James_Rustles]] from the depths of the facepunch forums. There were pictures.

☀http://www.jamesrustles.com/2015/05/2b2t-facepunch-history.html

In the far reaches of the minecraft community, there is a server called 2b2t.net. It’s open for many forums including Facepunch, 4chan, and Something Awful. I decided to head over to it one day to see what it was all about.


This is the spawn. The entire area around 1000 blocks of the spawn feels like a nuclear apocalypse, with ruined buildings, giant craters, and nothing surviving for more than a few days. It’s pretty much a cesspool of griefing and destruction. That’s what I loved about it, however. There was a raw feel of survival. No rules, no admins, full strategy and PvP action.


I joined this server, and some buddies of mine joined on as well, Mattyyy and Coolity. We took refuge underneath this.


We later met with the creator of this “castle” and learned of its history, but for then, we just hid in the expansive mines underneath it. There were thousands of tunnels under it, and led to many areas around the spawn. It was a true set of catacombs.


After a little bit, a thread of mine about this server gained popularity, and many other facepunchers joined in the fun. We eventually had a bustling area simply built around a single staircase.


Eventually, we moved out to a separate castle due to the lack of space and being too close to the spawn. This castle was an amazing fortress of solitude and happiness. We eventually got a working system of government (for the most part), jobs, and a decent infrastructure of facepunchers. Here’s a picture of a meeting. (I’m the one at the front of the room)


Sadly, all things had to come to an end. Base number two was destroyed by hackers with their hacked in TNT.


We found another base the next day. It was a bustling castle with a wide open courtyard. Some 4channers with hacks shortly destroyed this too.


Facepunchers are persistent, so we moved onto another area. After a brief struggle with two separate bases, we moved into a cave system, led again by me. We made a nice courtyard, fountain, and other fun things.


This base lasted a while. I moved from it for a bit, and let Icytruth take control of it in place of me. Sadly, it was taken by creepers. Numerous explosions near the entrance flooded it, and creepers were swept in by the water, making it inhabitable. It was lost and forgotten.

Base number 5 was found completely by accident. After the creeper invasion, I moved elsewhere to find a nice area for a sweet underground base. After digging down a bit, I fell into this:


This base was the best of them all. We inhabited it and changed it to our needs. I’m not exactly sure how the base fell, but I think it was a friendly hacker turning evil after someone hurt him. Not too sure, but it was later inhabited again. Not sure if people still live there. The location was later told over chat by KombatDoctor, and the location compromised. It’s likely being griefed and looted right now.

Eventually, we moved and created base number six. I put Startoad in charge of this one, and he ran it pretty well with the exception of a bit of bickering between him and Dachande. It was named Camp General Discussion, and another camp was made into Camp Creationism Corner. This is when I worked on a secret project, “Project Arsenal”, a mob trap hidden in a desert, made to provide military equipment to our military to ward off hackers and other potental threats.


From here on out, the history gets muddled. There’s multiple bases used to house people from different camps. Life is pretty well, except for two mysterious people in diamond armor that scared us near spawn.

Camp Creationism Corner Flourishes, and mweorz helps us out a bit. He ends up being a great friend and helper. Sadly, this comes to an end like all bases. I logged off for the night, and all or items were gone (Still wondering if that was some FP members, taking it to the new base?), the place trashed, and the place deserted. Bennyhill and rage639 take the base to attempt to look for materials, but obviously fail. I hit them with some lava and a sword, and die valiantly after attempting to run away and logging off.

This is a brief history of the Facepunch campaign in this server. Tell me if you have pictures or more info! When this is all over (server shutdown, ultimate destruction of facepunchers, total conquering of the entire server), I’ll make a thread about it, much like the Wurm Online story that always seems to be around on GD.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1086">Chrisleighton was an oldfag and server regular that played from 2011 to mid 2012. He was quite a sadistic person, he would often go into autistic griefing rampages, however, his base-mates saw him as a nice person, for some reason. He once put lava all over spawn, so that if someone died and came to square one, they died. 
==CHRISLEIGHTON: KING OF 2B2T==
Chrisleighton was infamous for spamming in chat with this message: &quot;CHRISLEIGHTON IS THE KING OF 2B2T! U MAD (N-Word)! U MAD NEWFAGS!&quot;. He spammed it so widely that most just accepted it so that he would shut up for once, remember that /ignore still was not a thing back then. 

Most of his base-mates and other 2b2t players tolerated the autistic piece of shit, until one day were x0XP had gotten enough of him. x0XP discovered that Chris Leighton was his real name, and was able to discover his true identity and doxx him, making Chrisleighton quit the server. In his absence, the title of King of 2b2t was passed on.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1616">{{2B2T Player Template|approx_join_date = Unknown|status = Active|known_alternates = Unknown|current_affiliation(s) = None}}ChromeCrusher, also known as the Second [[Popbob]] , is a player on 2b2t. He began to gain fame on Late 2016, after being able to find [[Fitlantis]] due to a new coords exploit that involved bedrock. However, Chrome was still able to find [[Fit]] 's new base (that he was constructing on February 2017) even if Fit did not show bedrock. He likely located it by searching for the exact same positions of ores, dirt, diorite, andresite, granite, or even flowers in a world with the same seed as 2b2t.

== History ==
Not much is known about him in the past, except he became famous when he was the first one to find Fitlantis. He did not grief the base, however this led to other groups being able to find Fitlantis and wage a huge battle there.

A few months later, in February 2017, Chrome returns and interrupts Fit's building of a new base. He is unsuccessful in killing Fit (currently unkown why he tried to kill Fit). He also left a Chrome's Crusher sword on a gold cross in [[Toro's Theater|Torogadude's Theater]] and like Fitlantis he did not grief it. He based with Fit and AlphaComputer at the skybase Fit is livestreaming. When the base was griefed he went on to destroy [[Summermelon]].

== Exploit ==
His coord exploit proved one thing in Minecraft as a game, that the bedrock pattern is the same for every world. This led to him being able to find underground bases easily, such as the Fitlantis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4227">Coltsnid is a [[Social Classes|midfag]] who is the co-founder and supreme leader of [[the Vortex Coalition]], and has been so for the entirety of VoCo's existence.

He is also the owner of the Spawn Infrastructure Group, which oversees the building of 2b2t spawn highways.

Coltsnid is a moderator for [[HermeticLock]]'s 2b2t.online project, as well as an admin on this wiki.

== Career ==
Coltsnid joined on August 17th, 2014 from a [[subreddit|Reddit]] thread. During his first few months, he would simply explore and die in and near spawn, until December of 2014 when [[AmericanOreo]] , an IRL friend of Colt's for 7 years, first joined. The two decided to walk through the nether to 100,000 blocks out from spawn (overworld) and founded a small base which they would work on once in awhile. Eventually, the two founded the Vortex Coalition in late May of 2015 and transitioned their forementioned base into the first VoCo HQ, and invited some friends to the base.

Eventually Coltsnid created the spambot [[VoCo bot|DeadlyMause]]. Colt and Oreo then designed several dozen messages for it, in order to establish VoCo's presence on the server, and gain new members. This is when several oldfags and other midfags at the time began to get annoyed by the slowly rising group, and claimed the group as a small and retarded newfag group, that would never be able to achieve [[Valkyria|Valkyria's]] great wonder and die in a month. However, as the group's presence increased, and they gained attention (from constant spam) and power, these haters began to decrease, and several of them began not to care about VoCo one way or another, some eventually accepting them as an actual group.

When Colt is on 2b2t he is building bases and recruiting people to join the VoCo ranks. During the early parts of 2016, Colt and Oreo were not too active and VoCo was not as present on the server. The two returned, however, right before the [[TheCampingRusher|Rusher]] influx began. Colt and Oreo established the VoCo discord in mid-2016, in which all members could join. They faced their first &quot;competition&quot; with [[the 4th Reich]], a group that formed on discord and were supposed to be VoCo's opposite. The two had a &quot;war&quot;, however this whole thing was actually a meme created by the groups to bring attention to themselves, which worked very well.

During the Rusher Period, VoCo remained relatively neutral, and sustained the highest peak of their power as the group gained several members due to the flood of Rushers. The Vortex Coalition remained very active until January of 2017, when [http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/The_Vortex_Coalition#Phase_II Phase II] came to a close.  

There was a lot of controversy near the end of Phase II due to a very high level of complex memes being produced by several parties. Coltsnid &quot;disbanded&quot; the group and deleted their original discord server which brought a lot of attention to those involved. He then started a new discord server with the name &quot;VoCo II&quot; and then &quot;sold&quot; it to HermeticLock as a meme. After the deletion of the first VoCo discord server, the new &quot;VoCo II&quot; discord gained far more members than the original one had, over 200. 

In June of 2017, VoCo awoke from dormancy and began [http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/The_Vortex_Coalition#Phase_III Phase III], this was the latest The Vortex Coalition had ever began a phase, with the first two beginning in May of both 2015 and 2016. With 2b2t falling into decline, activity in The Vortex Coalition will likely never reach the levels it had during the Rusher Era, but the current Vortex Coalition discord (the aforementioned &quot;VoCo II&quot; discord) has a current population of 145 members, after purging inactive accounts. 

Coltsnid continues to guide The Vortex Coalition into the direction of success, building infrastructure to recruit and base an influx of new members, in anticipation for the server population spike from the AntVenom video. 

Today (mid-2018), The Vortex Coalition discord server has over 550 members, with over 150 of them being registered members of VoCo. Inactive members of the discord are removed regularly. [[Category:Players]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3987">Coordinate Exploits are exploits that allow people to locate bases and structures around the server. 2b2t has had (so far) 3 major coordinate exploits that have caused the griefing of several bases of all sizes.

== The Thunder Hack ==
The Thunder Hack was a coordinate exploit that was used by the infamous [[Popbob]] . This hack allowed him and a select few to track down players and bases within months, weeks, or even days. The reason they have to &quot;track down&quot; players is because the hack does not specifically give exact coordinates of bases or players to the user but rather the relative area of the target player, in which lead the user of the hack to have to track the player's movements in order to find their base. It used the Minecraft mechanic where lightning strikes only in loaded chunks by a particular player and allowed the users to know exactly where that lightning struck and gain a relative idea of the player's location and potentially bases.

Popbob used this hack to find hundreds of bases and caused several players to quit. The hack was eventually patched when [[Hausemaster]] disabled lightning from the entire server. The lightnings later got re-enabled, as the hack is now blocked by NCP, likely due to being released to the public as a part of the [[Hacked Clients|Wurst Client]] .

== GeorgeBush420 ==
During the third backdoor of 2b2t, The Back Door Crew used [[hausemaster's]] alt account, georgebush420, to teleport to other players and grief their bases. Patched when Hause took back his account.

== Exploit of Late 2016 ==
The coord exploit of this time is technically 2 exploits. Both were made by [[ChromeCrusher]] &quot;the 2nd Popbob&quot;. The 1sr exploit involved using bedrock patterns to find the coords of any base as long as a picture or video was provided. This exploit was used by Chrome to find [[Fitlantis]] , and for [[Fit]] to tour several bases on his channel. This exploit is available to the public.

The 2nd exploit is a bit more unkown in terms of how its used. All thats known is that the exploit uses flowers (according to ChromeCrusher although maybe he was joking). This exploit is yet to be released and has been used by Chrome to find Fit's base that he never got to finish and Torogadude's theater. The exploit (allegedly) relies on the positional randomization system that Minecraft uses to offset the stems of flowers. When you place a flower by hand, one is created by bone meal, or generates naturally it does not sit in the center of the block. a randomization system is used to add some false variety visually to a large number of placed flowers. This random location is based on distance and seed (allegedly) and as a result a large enough sample of flowers combined with using the sun to determine the image's direction relative to the world can allow you to determine coords. This is not fully confirmed. There is also a theory that the exploit reverse engineers Minecraft's &quot;random&quot; texture rotation function on things like stone and grass.

This speculation has lead to the creation of &quot;static state&quot; texture packs. This is accomplished by purposefully setting only one block rotation state in the resource pack to override default minecrafts rotation settings. This is done via the block rotation `.json` files found inside the resource pack file structure at &quot;/assets/minecraft/blockstates&quot;.

Example the code for Netherrack.json corresponding to the rotational perimeters for Netherrack would be

{

  &quot;variants&quot;: {

      &quot;normal&quot;: { &quot;model&quot;: &quot;netherrack&quot; }

  }

}

Again this is based on second party information and speculation.

== Terrain Exploit ==
Using a  program developed by ChromeCrusher and the world seed one is able to search the entire world for matching natural terrain based off any photograph or video that includes such and inputting in key biomes and relative information one can gather from said photo or video to find the coordintates of the place photographed or videoed[[Category:Exploit]]</text>

'''CorruptedUnicorn''' was the leader of the Resistance. &lt;span&gt;He rose to infamy after griefing the historic monument &quot;&lt;/span&gt;The Valley of Wheat&quot;. Since then, he has been a greater threat to [[Team Veteran]] then [[TheCampingRusher]] himself. Corrupted and the Resistance prefer to patrol spawn in great numbers, forcing players to either run away, log, or accept death.

== History ==
CorruptedUnicorn first joined 2b2t on June 22nd, 2016. He made his first video on 2b2t about a floating island base. He continued to make videos until he began making friends on the server.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="891">CreamOfTheSlop was a Facepuncher that, similarly to [[Harblax]], converted to the 4channers. He is most famous for his later griefs and basing with oldfags like PoliceMike55 and [[Passie05]] in Passie Town. CremeOfTheSlop quit 2b2t in 2013 (?) and started to play games like League of Legends, this can be seen through his [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs0x-vSLh51l6NkkglHBFEw Youtube channel] . He also has a [https://slopofthecream.deviantart.com/ DeviantArt account] . On his DeviantArt gallery he has a few screenshots of a costum texturepack taken in 2b2t, in these we can see chat messages from PoliceMike55, Passie05 and [[Popbob]] (Who wasn't on his Autismal Outburst at the time).[[File:Minecraft_nuka_cola_bottles_test_by_slopofthecream-d4hyobi.png|thumb|302px|CremeOfTheFlop's Texturepack]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1886">{{Rusher}}
CurtPvP, or Curtis, is a small youtuber who is friends with [[TheCampingRusher]] and owns Rusher's factions server, [[The Archon]], and was one of his comrades during [[the Rusher War]]. Curtis is a poorfag who's life consists of praising eminem for his rap music. He is also known to be somewhat of an admin of 2b2t due to events during the Rusher War.
[[File:Photo-2.jpg|thumb|100x100px]]

== Rise to &quot;Administrator&quot; ==
Since Curt is friends with Rusher in real life, he was obviously a part of [[Team Rusher]] during [[the Rusher War]]. However, Rusher gave him a special role during the war to essentially be a sort of ambassador to [[Hause Master|HauseMaster]]. During the war, Rusher suggested to Hause a much better queue system than the much earlier one implemented early June, 2016. Curt was given the responsibility by Rusher to be in charge of 2b's current queue system when Hause gave permission to Rusher to implement it. He continues to be in charge of the queue system to this day.

== Drama ==
Curtis and his powers over the server has been criticized and theorized by many players on 2b2t. Many people believe that Curtis is abusing his status, with many having screenshots of conversations (twitter most often) of him threatening to ban or kick them. It is also speculated that he has /op on the real 2b2t server (the queue server is different and owned by Rusher) which may be why Rusher and his fags were geared so quickly. Curtis was semi responsible for #FreeToro, one of the last respectful things Fit has done. Rusher ordered Curtis to remove Torogadude from the Vet Queue because he was effective in opposing rusher's Narrative.

It has also been speculated that Curtis owns the 2builders2tools admin on the 2b2t subreddit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1951">The Dark Souls Castle is one of the most famous and largest builds in 2b2t. It was built during 2013 by the player Spoiler Alert. The iconic duel between [[TheCampingRusher|Rusher]] and [[Fit]] took place here during the peaks of [[the Rusher War]] .
[[File:2017-08-22 19.26.22.png|thumb|220x220px]]

== Architecture ==
{{Space_Valkyria|title1 = Dark Souls Castle|built = Sometime during 2013|coordinates = X: -12,524 Y: 65 Z: 9,260|destroyed = December 8, 2016|builder = SpoilerAlert|griefer = Lifeisgood72|dimension = Overworld}}The castle is based off of the Sen's Fortress from Dark Souls I. The castle is extremely detailed to almost perfectly replicate the original. It has massive corridors and stairs climbing around the landscape. It also has several small town areas filled with detailed markets, villagers, and livestock. It also had a ruin aspect to it as the builder, Spoiler Alert, intended for the castle to look that way.

== Rusher War ==
During the heights of the Rusher War, the famous duel between Rusher and Fit took place in the Dark Souls Castle. In August 5th, 2016, Fit invited Rusher to a duel. Rusher agreed, and the two fought here. The battle ended in Fit's victory, however some people just think that this is just a duel to find out who truly is stronger in a 1v1, and that the real battle took place in [[The Biggest Battle in 2b2t History]] .

== Demolition ==
While throughout it's lifespan it has had parts blown off of it or partially griefed by new players (due to how close it is to spawn), the base wasn't properly griefed until 12-8-17, where Lifeisgood72 decided to grief it with Sevorus using more than 4 inventories of TNT. [http://imgur.com/a/YcFZi Here] is the album showing pictures of the base while it was being griefed.[[Category:Bases]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="911">Deathspammers are players who flood the chat with death messages by repeatedly committing suicide. While normal chat spammers can simply be ignored individually using the /ignore command, the same is not true for death messages which can only be disabled entirely.

Players usually use two methods for death spamming. The first is simply setting your spawn point near a lethal drop and enabling autowalk and autorespawn, resulting in repeated death by fall damage. The second and more widely used method is to set a spawn point in the path of hostile mobs which can kill the player very fast. If they are renamed then they will not despawn and they can be used to convey messages in chat (ie. Player was killed by [message]). This was used during the [[Kinorana Map Crisis]] to spread anti-Kinorana propaganda.

[[File:DemonElite Paw.png|thumb|220x220px|Demon Elite Paw]]
DemonElite119 joined during early in the year 2012, during the tail-end of what is now known as the [[Facepunch Era]]. He was exposed to 2b2t by the threads on Facepunch and was motivated to join based on the appeal of a truly rule free environment.

== History ==
During most of his early days on 2b2t, he largely kept to himself or associated with a couple of friends that he joined with. Often in spawn, he would find simple fun in placing cobble and grass in order to fruitlessly beautify the apocalyptic landscape that was spawn. 

It was only later, in early 2014, the nether-roof glitch enabled him to travel to lands that have not been touched, lands that other people have yet to reach. It was at these far away lands that he established the region known as The Land of Wolves. 

This was not the only base he established during his time on 2b2t. Bases he is also known to have established are [[Yiffington I]] as well as Zootopia. There are also untold other bases and stashes that have yet to be uncovered. In addition to his own personal bases, he has also performed work at what is known as [[Wrath Outpost]] during the Third Spawn Incursion, largely working on entry ways, gathering materials, repairing damage, building decorative builds, and watching for (and attacking) those on the &quot;Kill on Sight&quot; list. At Wrath Outpost, he resided in a base located under the giant obsidian paw featured at the outpost. Around the time of the Vice article, where a miniature spawn incursion took place, he also resided at [[New Niggington]], founded by [[Caleesii]]. At New Niggington, he helped organize and optimize the base design, repairs to local landscape, camouflaging, and restoring structures even a year after its griefing by [[c1yd3i]].

He has taken part in various notable events, such as the Third Spawn Incursion, Vice Mini-Incursion, Fourth Spawn Incursion, as well as the Fifth Spawn Incursion. His positions in each event vary, ranging from taking more of a lower role in the Third Spawn Incursion, to taking the role of a strategist and later leading the Fourth Spawn Incursion, as well as acting as the strategist and temporarily taking command of the Fifth Spawn Incursion until jared2013's return.

He is also largely responsible for the [[Lag Machines|lag machine]] activity during 2016 after [[TheCampingRusher]] arrived with his legions of fans, known as Rushers. With the onset of End Crystal bombings and nether bed bombings, as well as the general desertion of [[Spawn]] by all parties; he created a series of lag machines, in hopes of making 2b2t virtually unplayable for [[Old,Mid,Newfags|newfags ]]and unsuitable for filming by Youtubers such as TheCampingRusher. With the leak of lag machine designs by Torogadude to the general populace and with assistance from [[The 4th Reich|Sun_Wukon]] the two aided in driving TheCampingRusher off of 2b2t, ending the roleplay-war known as [[The Rusher War]].

His signature weapon is The Blade of Fursecution and his symbol is The Paw which is generally featured at all bases he resides in or temporarily occupies. Bases that he builds at, or intends to stay at for extended periods of time also feature his signature wolf statues, signifying an entry to his designated territory of the base, as he tends to occupy large swaths of landmass, involving heavy terraforming or tunneling.[[Category:Old Fag]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4088">[https://www.youtube.com/user/doctrzombie Doctrzombie] is a [[Middlefaggot]] on 2b2t, and one of the earliest YouTubers present on the server, having videos dating back to March of 2013. He is best known for his series 'Advanced Minecraft: 2b2t - The World's Worst Server'.

== History ==

Doctrzombie joined 2b2t on the 3rd of March, 2013. His video, titled &quot;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIlcLPJqvvA Advanced Minecraft Presents: 2b2t - the world's worst server],&quot; gained him much attention and he swiftly became the known YouTuber of 2b2t. For the years preceding June 1st, 2016, doctrzombie was a well-known and friendly presence on the server, and for a long time he was the only true youtuber on the server, as the all other players that posted youtube videos (such as [[Fit]] and [[Sato86|Sato]]) didn't do so with any regularity, as Doctrzombie did. He created a long video series spanning ten seasons over three years that featured him building, exploring, and surviving on 2b2t. 

His YouTube videos had won him many allies, and he was often the force that drew players to the server. During the [[Rusher War]], he allied with [[Team Veteran]] and cooperated with [[Fit]]. 

Doctrzombie and Fit did a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_CGzn02URg collaborative stream] on September 17th, 2016, fighting around spawn with others including [[NedaT]], xPandaMCx and [[Babbaj]]. During this stream they build Fort Dick, a small building in spawn and defended it against invaders. It, like everything at spawn, was destroyed. 

Sometime later, Doctrzombie announced he was going to 'Make Fort Dick Great Again', referencing US President Donald Trump's famous slogan. He even made a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1QUjK4279E map art for it] and went to spawn to rebuild, only to discover the area was heavily withered and rebuilding was near impossible. 

On the April Fools map, Doctrzombie built Fort Dick 2.0 alongside many others.

== Videos ==
Doctrzombie has made numerous videos about 2b2t since his arrival in March 2013. His videos mostly consist of him exploring the server, looking at the various builds around Spawn and visiting some bases as well him building his own. His series is divided up into Seasons. At the time of writing, Doctrzombie is currently on Season 10 of his series.

== Trivia ==
* Doctrzombie is a father to three boys
* Doctrzombie has said several times in his videos (including his stream with Fit) that on the day Rusher arrived on 2b2t (June 1st 2016) he had recorded a video announcing his retirement from 2b2t. He dediced to stay on 2b2t due to the ensuing Rusher War.

The DonFuerian Empire (or simply Don Fuer) is an ideological group that was founded by D_loaded. The DonFuer translates to Fathers Gift and the group has been on several servers over several years. The group's goal is not to play games, and try to have enemies but rather just build and have a good time and influence the history on the server by action, not by [[VoCo|meme]] .

You can download the city [http://www.mediafire.com/file/7b25mi2bhy2pvwe/10th+Donfeur.zip here]

== History ==
The group or &quot;idea&quot;, as they call it, has existed since August of 2013. It has spread its influence across a few servers and has had 13 different Capital Cities. It was brought to 2b2t by [http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/The_Vortex_Coalition The Vortex Coalition.] The Supreme Leader of VoCo, [http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/Coltsnid Coltsnid], had appointed [http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/HermeticLock HermeticLock] as an executive member of the group. Herm was friends with D_loaded and suggested to Coltsnid that they recruit him into VoCo to build a large city for the group. Colt went with Herm to the 9th DonFuer on another server, and convinced D_loaded to join VoCo and build a city on 2b2t.

The 10th city was founded on December 11th, 2016. It stood for just over one month, until its coordinates were leaked by Coltsnid on January 14th, 2017, due to the group's claim to be responsible for &quot;The Fall of VoCo&quot;. 30 minutes later, [[Babbaj]] arrived at the city and attacked, turning the city into ruin. The 11th city was abandoned before completion because Hermeticlock was starting the Spawn Masons.  
The 12th DonFuer was completed on July 10th, and griefed on 9/9, along with Don Meer, Don Hoggal, and Los Garr. Llane griefed DonFuer 12, to put the base on the museum working with Beardler.
[[File:FsNc6RtD2fTyhtjvu9y9tpOZ0NYKY1wqtRfYa0itfi0.jpg|thumb|220x220px]]
its members (the DonFuerians) are able to participate and roleplay in city functions without worrying about other groups. The group also believes that when you say Hail DonFuer, you're not declaring allegiance to a player or a group, but rather declaring your allegiance to Building thematic Masterpieces you can have pride in.

The DonFuer has several custom made hacked clients with unique exploits only DonFuerians have access to in which they can use to defend themselves or use to aid in construction.[[File:Capture-1494028415.PNG|thumb|324x324px|DonFuer Banner]]

== Trivia ==
* The group has several mottos such as &quot;LONG LIVE THE DONFUER&quot;, &quot;The Empire is Now&quot;, &quot;The Don has come&quot;, and &quot;Hail DonFuer&quot;
* The group is one of the few groups in server history to have come over from another server (if not the only). Several groups have been known to spread out beyond 2b, mainly to clones, but rarely vice versa.

* llaurscat (Elder)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1105">The Donkey Dupe, also known as the Cact-Ass Dupe, was a [[Duplication Glitches|duplication exploit]] found in March 2017 that is larger than the [[11/11 Dupe]]. It was a simple dupe exploit involving breeding donkeys and teleporting them to the Nether. It remains one of the largest dupes in 2b2t History. It only lasted for three days but was the most overpowered dupe in history (thus far).

== The Exploit ==
The Exploit consists of a few steps:
* Breed Donkeys
* Put a chest to the Donkey, and place the items you want to dupe in it.
* Put Donkeys to a magma block until it reaches half a heart.
* Teleport it into a Nether Portal with Cacti surrounding it.
* The items will transport out of the nether portal, duplicated.

== Legacy ==
The exploit was considered to be so simple that the economy boomed overnight after this. It is possible a Sixth Spawn Incursion could occur out of this dupe. This also made the &quot;Cactus Dupe&quot; meme real in a way.

Almost every single item in 2b2t lost value, from elytras to God Apples.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8364">[[File:Dupe_stash.jpg|thumb|A common dupe stash]]
Dupe glitches are glitches that allow the player to duplicate any item they desire. There have been several dupe glitches throughout the history of 2b2t. While this is technically illegal on the server due to the rule against gamebreaking exploits, [[Hausemaster|Hause]] allows the players to keep the duplicated items, and doesn't hurry when it comes to patching them.

== Known Dupe Glitches ==
* Note: All minecart duplication glitches (which are all patched) mentioned here are all different versions of each other with slight differences in their usage.
* Beta 1.7 Piston Dupe Glitch of 2011 - The first dupe glitch brought to 2b2t by the [[Facepunch Republic]]. This dupe required normal pistons, sticky pistons, redstone, and redstone repeaters. This dupe could only duplicate blocks and not items (better than nothing). It required a player to create a fast redstone clock, a type of circuit that sends a signal forever at specific intervals, using redstone dust and two repeaters (look it up if you don't get it). The player would then hook up an output from the clock with one redstone dust extending out from the clock and into two other circuits. One leads directly to a sticky piston, the other leads to a repeater and normal piston. The player would then activate the clock by destroying a piece of redstone and quickly replacing it. This would cause both pistons to turn on and off indefinetly. Now all the player had to do was set the repeater hooked to the normal piston to three ticks and place the desired block in front of the sticky piston, causing the blocks to dupe and extend outwards indefinetly. This dupe was patched when [[Hause]] updated 2b2t to Beta 1.7.3, which also patched fly hacking.
* 1.4.7 Minecart Dupe Glitch of 2013 - This dupe glitch was the reason why [[Valkyria]] became powerful. It was similar to the dupe glitch in 2016 as they both used minecarts and a nether portal, however, it used a bit more redstone wiring and different method. This dupe involved pushing a minecart into a portal and getting the contents out before it entered the portal, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TOwPWLlg0g according to video footage on kinorana's channel] (you had to be in freecam while doing this).
* Minecart Dupe Glitch of 2016 (Veteran Version (Known Since 1.7)) - This dupe glitch used a minecart with a chest that would do the exact same thing as the Bypass version with the exception of no player on the other side and instead of the minecart going directly onto the hopper, it would go on a slight rail slope. This dupe was patched on July 22nd, 2016.
* Minecart Dupe Glitch of 2016 (Bypass Version) - This dupe glitch used a minecart with a hopper or chest that would go through a Nether portal. After it arrived at the nether, another player would stand near a hopper right outside of the portal, in order to load the chunk, which would duplicate the item. This dupe was patched on July 27th, 2016.
* [[11/11 Dupe]] - This dupe was discovered by the server on November 11th, 2016. It is the largest dupe in all of 2b2t history. The dupe is performed when a player intentionally gets kicked from the server as the player drops items at the exact same time. The player then returns to find the items duplicated. This dupe has been patched on November 28th, 2016 as the server was updated to 1.11. The easy way to duplicate items was leaked to the 2b2t community, causing mass duping across the entire server. On 11/19, a client made to make duping easier was spread among the community. However, the client was actually backdoor'd, and people who duped using the client had their stashes leaked on the 2b2t Reddit. This did not stop players, as there were other clients to use. The 11/11 dupe ended when 2b2t was updated to 1.11 on 11/28.
* Cactus Dupe - ''Discovered'' on November 18th, 2017, the Cactus Dupe was a dupe in which was memed about a lot by the community due to it not lasting very long. It has been memed about by several groups and players, especially Team Pepsi, who meme discovery rights over the dupe. The dupe worked by setting up a railroad leading to a cactus. The cactus needed to be in a lazychunk radius, which meant that a player would have to move the right distance or lower their render distance in order for the dupe to work. A lazychunk is just a chunk that's far enough away from the chunks you've loaded so that it's not technically loaded, but you can still push redstone updates to it. Then the player would send a chest/hopper minecart to the cactus with the items. Players had to make sure that the cactus chunk was loaded correctly. Just before the minecart ran into the cactus, the player would have to move away from the cactus chunk with precise timing in order to dupe. This also only works on servers that have artificial chunk load settings. The dupe is still memed to work by the community to fool any oncoming newfags.
* [[Donkey Dupe]] - This dupe is by far the biggest dupe due to its use of shulker boxes, outranking even the 11/11 dupe. It occurred sometime in March of 2017. The dupe involved getting a donkey to half a heart putting shulker boxes of items in its inventory, then sending it through a portal to die by a cactus on the other side. The contents would then spit back to the overworld duped. This dupe lasted 3 days yet managed to devalue even stacked armor as players and youtubers like BarrenDome and others used this dupe to get more stacked armor.
* The Llama Dupe (Donkey Dupe V2) - This dupe involved a similar method to the donkey dupe however, instead used a llama. It was discovered in late March of 2017 and eventually patched late April of 2017. The dupe itself was less publicized than the Donkey Dupe in order for it to have lasted longer.
* 1.12 Crafting Dupe - This dupe was found by [[Chunkr]] and leaked by [[kinorana]] as soon as the server updated to 1.12 on July 23rd, 2017. The dupe involved using the new crafting recipe book introduced in the 1.12 update. The dupe worked by dropping the item that the player wanted to dupe and then quickly spam clicking on any crafting recipe in the book, which would transfer blocks from your inventory into the small crafting interface in your inventory screen. When the player picked up the desired item while still spam clicking on the recipe in the book, a glitch would happen where the item would immediately stack to 64. This would even stack items that are normally unstackable, such as armor, weapons, tools, shulker boxes (with items in them), and totems, allowing for instant god status. The dupe was quickly patched on July 24th, 2017 by Hause and he immediately classified these stacks of unstackable items as illegals, preventing any items going above x64 (or x1 if you are duping totems) from going in chests or on the ground without resetting. [[Fit|FitMC]] somewhat bypassed this by throwing the duped items into a hopper. However, a more efficient version was found out by simply by using 4 stacks of wood and the item you are duping. Once duped, you throw out the item one by one to prevent the items being patched. This does not require a hopper. Mojang took quick action to the dupe, and patched it in the 1.12.1 update, attempting to dupe in 1.12.1, will crash your game.

== Other Lesser Known/Extra Dupes ==
The EnderChest dupe was a public (yet) but still a bit secret dupe as people thought it was fake, It was active in 1.10, 1.10.2, 1.11, 1.11.2 and 1.12. Its now patched by either [[hausemaster]] or PaperSpigot, it worked like this:
* Open a enderchest, look at the GOLD plate on it
* Drop a item while in the enderchest / or pick it up at the same tick you open it
* Dropping the item while in the enderchest will eventually cause it to duplicate once.

'''AKA. SLOW DUPE. '''(It could take many hours to dupe the item just once)

The Zombie dupe might seem like the Donkey and Llama dupe from 1.11.2.

To do it: (maybe isnt 100% accurate)
* Make a Zombie (Regular) wear any type of armor and push it thro a End Portal (might work with nether )
* Make it a HALF HEART before you push it in, make it take damage at the EXACT same tick as it dies when it goes thro the portal.
* If you are lucky, it will duplicate.

== '''About ''' ==
ElRichMC is a Spanish YouTuber from Galicia, Spain. He uploads mostly technical Minecraft videos to his channel, as well as minigames, and CTM's. He created and successfully did 3 CTM's by himself, and a very advanced survival world. He constantly works on his survival world during streams on his [https://www.twitch.tv/elrichmc Twitch page].

&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;ElRichMC joined YouTube on March 17th, 2012 and has over 230 million total views on YouTube. According to [https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/elrichmc SoicalBlade], ElRichMC makes upwards for $120,000 US dollars yearly from his YouTube earnings. His most popular video[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Io4iK-uwNos] has gained over 1.9 million views.

== Notable achievements on 2b2t ==
* Brought an influx of new players, starting the &quot;bean/taco invasion&quot;

== Future on 2b2t? ==
Obviously, no one can say for certain what ElRichMc will do in the future on the server, however, his video on 2b2t has gained well over 300,000 views with many fans calling for a series. ElRichMC stated that if he gets 250,000 views on his &quot;oldest&quot; server in minecraft video, then everyone can expect there will be a series. This goal has passed, but nothing planned by ElRichMC. A youtuber of his size could easily make a massive a group and quickly receive resources from fans and supporters.

In a recent Twitch stream, he mentioned that he had something planned for 2b2t, and told his fans that he thinks they are going to like it. Possibly in the stream &quot;Terminando el Incinerador&quot;. He later promised not to return due to &quot;racism&quot; on the server.

[[File:MortAmos's_Manor.png|thumb|left|208px|Front view of MortAmos's Manor]]MortAmos's manor is a green second empire themed style home that was situated upon an unfinished manmade hill. The manor is situated westward from the Capitol Building. Physical architecture details include: three main stories, Italian Style Porch front wrap, three planned turrets, mansard roof, dormers, and a five storey tower. Construction of the house began on the twenty-fifth of November during 2017. Majority of materials for the manor were manually harvested from the Northern Mesa, which soloplayer's railway connected to, and the North Eastern Desert across the bay.        

The manor was originally abandoned once the front was completed due to academic and personal events in[[File:Incomplete_Areas.png|thumb|158px|Incomplete areas ]] MortAmos's life. The other two walls were later begun due to later drama in Empire's Edge when Slimestoner stated MortAmos was too inactive, leading into a heated argument where MortAmos eventually decided to work on the manor again. Not long after working on the manor again, the Sixth Incursion was declared and MortAmos left Empire's Edge for spawn. After the disbandment of the Sixth Incursion, MortAmos did not get around to returning to Empire's Edge and was at spawn during the grief. {{2B2T Build Template|title1 = Empires Edge|type = Base|status = Greifed|players_who_live(d)_here = TheDark_Emperor, blackcooper, GlowskiBroski, Soviet_Infidel, SlimeStoner, FallsGreen, diagoportion, Ericudo, Niftyrobo, rootbeerguy1212, Soloplayer88, MortAmos}}

== '''Arrowhead (Built by Ericudo)''' ==
Around early February of 2017, the [[Emperium]] began designs and the creation of its first major base. Around the time, the Emperium had just begun to get its name out there with its new alliance with [[Singularity]] and only had around 20 active people in the group. Of these 20 people, only around 8 were invited to the base they deemed &quot;Arrowhead&quot; because of its arrow-like design. The build took around a week to get the main layout completed set up and the underground carved out, but many positive memories were made and the group found that bases were a very good way to bond with members.
[[File:Arrowhead.jpg|thumb|255x255px|Arrowhead]]
[[File:Arrowhead 2.0.png|thumb|253x253px|The outer shell being built]]
In honor of Arrowhead, Emperium member &quot;Ericudo&quot; decided to build a slightly smaller version of it at Empires Edge. Since the general layout was already understood, it took him only 5 hours to finish the entire shell, and while the entire build was never fully completed, it was a testament to how far the Emperium had come on its own.

Arrowhead is still around today, though dormant.  [[Category:Places]]

Enchanted glass was a [[Hacked Items|hacked item]] created during the third [[Backdoors|backdoor]]. It was literally just stained glass blocks of various colors with high level (though not unobtainably high) sword enchantments put on them. What made them special was the fact that after 1.9, enchantments can’t be applied to items which those enchantments aren’t intended for without using commands. The reason is because, due to the limit on weapon attack speed, a non-weapon item with weapon enchantments will do more damage per second than a diamond weapon with the same enchantments, as long as you click fast enough.

The idea behind creating enchanted glass was precisely this, to create a weapon more powerful than a diamond sword. Why stained glass blocks, of all things, were chosen for this, remains anybody's guess. The most likely reason may have been so that, if the user was about to be killed in PVP, they could place their enchanted glass, causing it to lose all of its enchantments and become just a regular glass block, preventing their killer from taking possession of it. Making it glass would ensure that the killer wouldn't even get a free block for their trouble, unless they happened to have a silk touch axe on them. Since this was before the curse of vanishing was added, this would have been rather convenient.

Originally there were few of these, but during the early stages of the [[The Rusher War|rusher war]], [[Babbaj]] and other players who possessed them gave them to other [[Team Veteran|veterans]], most notably [[Fit]], to use in combat. The veterans created more of them during this time using the 2016 minecart [[Duplication Glitches|dupe]]. When the [[The Resistance|resistance]] got their hands on both the minecart dupe and some copies of enchanted glass, they, too, were able to use the enchanted glass against their enemies. This prompted some of the veterans to inform [[hausemaster]] of the existence of the minecart dupe, and he patched it, though the enchanted glass remained, for now.

Lots of end crystals were duped around the same time, and once people realized these were [[Suicide Bombing (Crystal/Bed Bombing)|a way more effective weapon]] than enchanted glass, it largely fell out of use. By the time hausemaster removed it along with all other items with “illegal” enchantments, people didn’t care very much, focusing rather on the impact of more major removals such as stacked armor.

If you want, you can use commands to put enchantments on glass blocks in a singleplayer world, and enchanted glass still exists in old 2b2t world downloads made before its removal, but on 2b2t itself, enchanted glass is lost to time.

==History==

Having joined on December 15, 2015 directly because of his brother [[Torogadude]], he remained on his own for a considerably long amount of time, including during the [[The Rusher War|Rusher War]]. He wasn't the most active pre june player when he first joined. He started to become more well known when he joined [[The Emperium]] sometime around late February. He wasn't known to be Toro's brother however, until Toro released his 10k special and mentioned his name. His more recent call to fame however has been due to the creation of the &quot;Faction Balls&quot; that he occasionally will post on the [[Subreddit|reddit]]. These balls are a play off of countryball comics and contains the current politics of the differing groups at the time (though most of them seem to be anti-[[The Peacekeepers|Peacekeeper]]) or major events that happen on the server.

'''The Facepunch''' '''Republic, '''also known as the Facepunch Alliance,''' '''was a group of players that joined in early 2011. They consisted out of www.facepunch.com users thus giving them their name. Their leader was known as [[Chezhead]], who lead the group up until October of 2011. Facepunch came to 2b2t to play and create cities where their forum members could build and bring a bit of order among the tides of anarchy by creating a perfect civilization where people had jobs and whatnot. Their initiate failed horribly as their actions were seen as an insult to the whole server, beginning a hunt for facepunchers on the server. This led to server wide [[The Facepunch War|conflict]] on the server and lead to their inevitable demise. After Chez left and gave up hope, the remaining facepunchers failed to keep the group together and eventually disbanded in February of 2012. Their forum was still essential to 2b2t to server as a media and a memory book of the server.

One of their main (and most notable) spawn bases was [[2k2k]] located at approximately X: -2000 Z: -2000. Built by facepunchers under Phagocytic, who took control after Chezhead’s departure and initial disband of the Republic, was their last ditch effort to fend off the attacking [[4channers|4chan Anarchists]]. Since their base was close to spawn, it was griefed multiple times, but it didn't stop the Facepunchers from repairing it for over a month. Eventually, the group began to once again decline, as more and more Facepunchers gave up on repairing 2k2k and either went to live somewhere else or left the server. Phago’s Republic collapsed in June of 2012. 2k2k is currently a giant lava cast with some of its former structure still buried under its stony grave. The last Facepunch thread was closed on the 7th June, 2015.

== Post Facepunch Eras ==
Despite the republic being disbanded and several facepunchers leaving after 2k2k, there were still facepunchers who remained (similar to how [[Team Rusher|Rushers]] still roam the server despite Team Rusher disbanding). These facepunchers either fused into new groups, went solo, or never advertised their facepunch origin and secretly made new bases (ie Hitlerwood).

The most notable group of facepunchers still remaining after the Rupublic's fall was the group started by Coldwave, in which he hoped to create a new Republic. He founded Hitlerwood which later fused with Anatolia (aka the Black Flag Group) to create [[Valkyria]]. So essentially Valkyria was the Facepunch Republic 2.0 due to their facepunch ancestry. Knightvista created the last facepunch base, Fort Avril, which was griefed. People still come to 2b2t from Facepunch to this day, despite very minimal, however obviously do not have any association with the Republic that existed years ago.

== Trivia ==
* Facepunchers still roam the server today such as [[popbob]], [[xcc2]], lemler33 and few others.
* The term Facepuncher is similar to Rusher as it is used in the exact same way. It was used to generalize a group of players and not necessarily mean they were part of the Republic (while most were) but just to refer to them that they came from facepunch
* The Republic named their bases federation shelters, outposts, camps, forts, and towns.
* The group had a system of social classes, which included (but not limited to) the President, advisors, mayors and citizens. Chezhead was the President of the Republic, which essentially meant he was the leader and had full power over it. He made the ultimate decisions. Advisors were put in place to keep bases in check and were required to arrange meetings with all advisors online in order to agree with large decisions, with Chezhead having the final say. Mayors ran towns and shelters and kept the citizens of the town in line. The citizens were basic builders and common players.
* The group undoubtedly left a legacy that is still seen today. Their failed attempts to create a sort of peace and order in anarchy changed the way players played 2b2t for years to come through creating base groups and just groups in general, seeking a system and a sort of order, good or bad, despite the ruthlessness and lawlessness of anarchy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1777">Known for being widespread across 2b2t during the Rusher War,  factions were groups that were prevalent due to Rusher being a factions player. These groups were usually comprised of his fans that took and played 2b2t as another factions server and kept treating it as one, making all sorts of little shitty groups. They are, however, distinguishable from regular groups because they were usually aimless, disbanded in like a day, roleplayed instead of actually contributing to an actual cause, and we’re generally looked down upon by oldfags. The usual more autistic groups that stood out were typically referred to as [[fagtions]]. After the Rusher War, these kinds of groups, fortunetly for the server, begun to decrease in prevalence and flat out ceased to exist few months afterwards.

The following terms for groups became prevalent, along with factions,  because of the Rusher War:
* Teams - Although used in 2b2t’s past, most prominent example being Team Sun, the term “team“ for groups became much more common during the war, due to the two main belligerents (Team Rusher and Team Veteran), and even afterwards. However,  it begun to be stigmatized when the childish fan base of Rusher kept saying “WHAT’S URE TEAM”, believing “team“ was an actual term used by 2b2t players.
* Clans - A rare term that was hardly used, THANK JESUS, but a term used nonetheless by the most autistic and cringiest of the nine year olds, who had to bring COC, to 2b2t.  This shouldn‘t even be considered a term on 2b, please don’t use it or you’ll be discrimated against and considered a retard (Blind Eye Clan gets an exception cuz they didn’t name their group after COC gameplay, still cringy though)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1954">Fake Wooden Slabs, also known as Alpha Slabs and Petrified Oak Slabs, are wooden slabs which were crafted before 1.3, when new wood slabs were added for all four of the wood types that were then in the game, whereas previously, all slabs crafted with wood would have the oak planks texture. Rather than all existing wooden slabs being converted into the new oak wood slabs, they remained in the game as a now-uncraftable item with strange properties. Whereas the new wood slabs were flammable, the old wooden slabs remained non-flammable, as they always had been. And because they were now considered a type of stone slab by the game (as the update grouped all the slabs into wood and stone categories, with only the new wood slabs being put into the wood category), they now required a pickaxe to efficiently break instead of an axe as before, and made the same noises when hit or walked on as stone-based blocks.

Like [[Alpha Leaves]], fake wooden slabs appear in inventory and storage slots as a pink and black checkerboard, which is used by Minecraft to indicate a missing item texture. When held in a player’s or zombie’s hand, they appear as oversized boxes, the size of a placed block, in the hand, with the pink and black error texture on all sides. When placed, they look like normal oak slabs, but have the physical properties of stone slabs, meaning it is fire proof and has more blast resistance. When put into an item frame, the item frame displays a pink and black checkered cube that takes up almost the entire frame.

Fake wooden slabs are no longer craftable, but lots of them which were obtained before 1.3 can still be found, and as they have been [[Duplication Glitches|duped]] a lot over the years, they are fairly common.

In the 1.13 update, they will be renamed from “wooden slab” to “petrified oak slab”, and their item texture will be fixed, but their stone-like properties will remain unchanged.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5828">The following is a list of famous builds, locations, and landmarks across 2b2t. Most have links to their designated pages. If they do not, feel free to create a new page for them, and/or create a small description on this list.

== Spawn ==
''See more: [[Spawn]]''

== Travel Methods ==

=== The Southern Canal ===
The Southern Canal is a man-made river that leads south from Spawn, following the z+ axis for over 70 thousand blocks. The advantages of travelling by the canal are that it does not consume hunger when using a boat, and that it avoids traffic of the nether highway. The south canal recently experienced heavy griefing by members of Team Cyber (VoCo subgroup) as well as [[The Vortex Coalition]] and may not be usable for a long time.
=== Nether Highways ===
The Nether Highways are the fastest way of legitimate travel in 2b2t. The Nether Highways are four long tunnels (one for each axis) lasting at an average of a million blocks. The longest highway is the positive X highway, spanning more than 3 million blocks.

The four highways are the following:
* [[+X Axis Highway]]
* [[-X Axis Highway]]
* [[-Z Axis Highway]]
* [[+Z Axis Highway]]

=== Overworld Highways ===
Overworld Highways are similar to the Nether Highways, though less popular and shorter. They consist of roads just lasting for around 100 thousand blocks.

== Sanctuaries ==
Referred to as sanctuaries, these are helping places for newfags on the server. They would usually only comprise of a simple farm and basic resources. However, there are two sanctuaries that are extremely famous.

=== Valley of Wheat ===
The Valley of Wheat is the largest sanctuary in 2b2t, and is the most famous one. It has also been griefed and rebuilt several times by various people. The valley began in 2011 by a player named Jaang.

''(See more: [[Valley of Wheat]])''

=== NFE/Negative Fourhundred Eighthundred ===
Negative Fourhundred Eighthundred, also its coordinates, is a sanctuary built during the 2011 era by xcc2. It has been griefed by Popbob for some unknown reason.

== Valkyrian Bases ==
===Valkyria===

=== Rhadamantis ===

=== Asgard ===
Written by Sato86 on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t/comments/5buzh9/bases_on_2b2t_that_never_came_to_be/
* Asgard I : http://imgur.com/a/ZaCSg (Courtesy of Mrx)
Asgard was marked for having the best terrain ever found on 2b2t (to that point). It was planned for the coming of 1.7 which was the biome update that would introduce the Savannas and mesas, as well as the mega taigas. Hause ,as always, was waiting for more stable plugins to update the server. That gave me time to lurk in singleplayer for a good terrain using the 2b2t map seed. Thats when I stumbled on the most magnificent mountain I ever seen. Everything around was so perfect. A huge lake beneath the two stone arms. Asgard I had everything to be the most fantastic base. And the builders? xcc2, passie, offtopia. The three legendary builders of 2b2t were there.

However the project failed. It was at this time that popbob learned of the exploit that would later be known as thunderhack. At the time we had no idea of how he found it, that spread a feeling distrust among the base members and the whole thing fell apart. Not even a new base was made after this one. I stopped playing for several months after this. Only later we would understand how pop found it. He had indeed told us the approximate coords to our base in public chat, but he said the wrong quad. It is likely he already knew the real coords and was just trying to mess with us as it was his habit.

Current State: Griefed and Abandoned.

=== Valhalla ===

=== Nova ===
Nova, aka West Novadelphia, was a [[Valkyria]]n base made on 3b3t during 2014. The base was where the builders of the later [[Fenrir]] would first unite.

== Other Places ==

=== Gape Bases ===
The two gape bases are underground bases built during the Legion-Gape Interlude.

=== Fitlantis ===
Fitlantis is a solo base built by FitMC after The Rusher War. It is an ocean monument turned into an underground base. It was first found by ChromeCrusher using a coordinate exploit which led to its eventual griefing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="242">FatMC is a meme involving [[Fit]] which is essentially supposed to act as a complete opposite of Fit (no shit). With Fit being &quot;fit&quot; and all, people around the 2b2t community came up with FatMC as an ironic joke against Fit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6822">{{copypaste}}The Fellowship of the Diamond, not to be confused with the Brotherhood of the Diamond, were a very early group on 2b2t. Below seen what is written by [[KillerCapybara]] on [[the 2b2t Blog]].   

The story begins in August 2011. My friends and I had been playing Minecraft together for awhile, experimenting with build challenges, adventure maps, and survival maps. While we had been enjoying the game, we were looking for something more to challenge ourselves and play with other people. One of my friends, zhode, had been browsing 4chan when he saw a post about 2b2t.net, a vanilla anarchy Minecraft server with no rules, mods, or admins. It looked perfect; a server that was challenging but still the same vanilla Minecraft experience. zhode had warned us that the first thing we would see when we logged on would show us exactly what we were getting into. I was the first to log on with him and the first thing I saw was a giant, flaming netherrack swastika above my head and two guys in diamond armor flying above us engaged in PVP combat. That was when we knew we had found our server. Our gang consisted of zhode, serphantking12, _ironeagle_, and myself. Together we sought out to survive and thrive in the most hostile server out there. The first base we set up was not too impressive and extremely close to spawn. We dubbed it our ‘700 Base’ as it was only 700 blocks away from spawn. This began our very uncreative naming scheme for all of our bases to come. It unsurprisingly did not last very long and we found ourselves moving even further away. Our next base was one we dubbed our ‘3000 Base.’ It was once again unimpressive but lasted us through September and part of October. Our base was only discovered once another person with the lack of knowledge to move further away from spawn moved in only a couple hundred blocks away. We packed up our limited supplies and decided to move even further away to a place where we felt safe. In mid-October, we built our biggest base yet. The '8000 Base' was the one we put the most effort into. It wasn't anything amazing and in many ways is extremely confusing and poorly designed. But it was our home so we didn't care. It was an underground base with necessities such as a large central tree farm, animal pens, and chest room along with some goofy stuff like an art gallery, a strip club, and a church dedicated to a sheep that we heard had crashed the server (though I'm not sure if that ever actually happened). Everything remained underground but eventually we constructed a cobblestone castle outside of our base. This was the only structure that would be above ground at the base for four years. We based together for awhile and eventually a bit of bickering began to bubble up in the group. After an incident involving me killing _ironeagle_ over some diamonds, we came to a consensus that we had to change some things to keep from falling apart. It was at this point we came up with a name for our group, the 'Fellowship of the Diamond.'  After the '8000 Base', a multitude of other bases were created by the 'Fellowship'. A small town called 'Diamond Town' was created in November 2011 with a population of about 8 players. It's notable for being around at the same time as Boatmurdered and we conducted trade with Andrew_Gil at a small trading post in the nether. We created a skybase which we named 'Laputa' after a flying island in Gulliver's Travels. There was the '9x9 Base' which was made with a member of 'Diamond Town' that didn't last too long. All of those bases were griefed shortly after their creation and in January 2012, the '8000 Base' was finally griefed as well. We moved away to our last base, created in September 2012, on a Mushroom Biome. At this point, most of the original members had gotten bored and stopped playing and it was just zhode and I. In October 2012, we left the server and, aside from stopping by to check on some of the older bases in 2013, stopped playing completely. In March 2015, I discovered James Rustles' 2b2t blog and began reading about all of the things that I had missed out on during my absence. Seeing the server thriving with all of these amazing bases and history inspired me to log in and play again. I managed to convince zhode to play again and brought a new friend, HyraxKing, to help restore the old '8000 Base'. HyaxKing was very productive and created many of the more prominent builds at the base today, such as the pagoda and the stone brick castle. I ended up building the stone brick tower and the tugboat (built in July 2015) that would go on to become synonymous with the base. Eventually, the base got raided and griefed once again and most of the members quit soon after. I moved out and started building a new base in March 2016. After FitMC made his video about the newly named 'Tugboat Base' in July 2016, I shared it with the older members and it inspired them to play again. We added a new member, KillerCommando29, and they came to the new base and helped to build our largest and most intricate one yet. Most of the members of the revitalized 'Fellowship of the Diamond' have since stopped playing and only occasionally come on to touch up their builds.  The 'Fellowship of the Diamond' has a long history on the server and has been mostly forgotten to time. A lot of the confusion about this group's history came from it's name. At the same time we were playing, another group began playing and called themselves the 'Brotherhood of the Diamond' and made themselves well known for helping people at spawn. Their name got spread around the server while ours didn't since we usually kept to ourselves. Over time, after our group had been long forgotten, people began to associate the two groups together and crediting the 'Brotherhood' with builds that had been built by the 'Fellowship'.  It's an easy to mistake to make and a funny coincidence that two different groups came up with such similar names at the same time. The build shown off in FitMC's second video, &quot;The Mystery of the Brotherhood&quot; was not constructed by us and features signs that seem to give a history of the '[[Brotherhood of the Diamond]]'. We never associated or worked with them while we were playing.  I hope that clears up some misconceptions I've seen about our history. It's been great to see as much interest as there has been about the group and seeing some of our work be talked about to the extent that it has been is very flattering. The 'Fellowship of the Diamond' doesn't look to have much of a future on the server, but it's always possible that one day we shall return full-force to continue making our archaic builds and carrying on our old traditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1682">Fenrir was a base built by the [[Nova]] base players when 2b2t came back online. The project took months to complete, but when it was finished, it was an eye-catching base (no joke). During the time Fenrir was built/being built, 2b2t was a place that &quot;was a Peaceful time and no major events.&quot; according to [https://imgur.com/gallery/rahd1 ArchQuantum's Imgur Post]. Other Then that, not much is know about Fenrir. {{2B2T_Build_Template|title1 = Fenrir|status = Griefed (Most Likey)|players_who_live(d)_here = Nova Base Players|builder(s) = Nova Base Players|realm = Overworld|image1 = 004-end (3).png}}

== Architecture ==
Based on the glimpses of builds in [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXz7E2GfEzc jamesrustles' video],
* Fenrir had a gold farm used for afk exp farming.
* A glass dome in the water that surrounded a small build.
* Subway systems that could transport you around the base
* A &quot;Fenrir Inn&quot;
* A temple with the [[Valkyria]]n eagle inside (altough the eagle is made of wood)
* A lighthouse
* A castle connected to the other side of the base
* An Eiffel tower build made of brown wool.
* A &quot;Replica of Spawn Beacon&quot; that has multiple signs, one reading &quot;Over 900 newfags died during the Spawn Ocupation&quot;
* And much more...
The base appears to be built mostly with dark oak wood and stone brick

&lt;--- [[Great Server Decay]]

&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;---&gt; [[Legion-Gape Interlude]][[File:00-ImageMain (4).png|thumb|240x240px]][[File:2b2t Timeline (1)-0.png|thumb|115x115px]]
The First Valkyrian Period is a period of 2b2t history named after [[Valkyria]], the biggest group at the time. Valkyria was founded when a few small groups merged together to build a city named Valkyria.

This Era marks when 2b2t was also in an era of stagnation which created a sort of peace on the server due to the lack of activity and low amount of players; except for the 2 [[Spawn Incursions]], the second used to prevent players from IGN and Reddit from invading the server.

Valkyria then wanted to make another base called [[Asgard]], but the plans were cancelled because Asgard was griefed before it was finished. This grief caused the end of the First Valkyrian Era.

* A then minor group, called N-War, was created in this period. It started as a joke with reference to the anti vietnam-war in the 60s &amp; 70s. It started becoming more and more signifcant as the spawn incursions became more frequent and longer. This group was not known to most (except a selected few who was affiliated with the then leaders) as they do not wish to promote the group to prevent insiding &amp; hatred from certain groups. Generally, they would operate in the shadows, saving as many lives as possible from the sidelines without facing the armies. They’re also notorious for their arrow-spams when encountered. It was rumored that 3 of them had actually held off one of the spawn incursions for an hour.

'''(Not to be confused with FatMC)'''

Fit and formerly called silentpedro, is a well known midfag on 2b2t and the leader of the [[Team Veteran|Veterans]]. He has been playing 2b2t since 2013, and gained popularity during [[The Rusher War]]. 
[[File:2.png|thumb|351x351px|Fit's skin (Custom made)]]
==Career==

=== Pre-Rusher ===
Fit joined 2b2t in the summer of 2013, during the second spawn incursion. He traveled thousands of blocks out &quot;surviving on zombie flesh and spider eyes&quot; before starting a farm. He made his first base in a winter biome near spawn but it was griefed by [[Popbob]] , who killed Fit during the grief. He was a loner for his first year or so of 2b2t, until he was invited by [[James_Rustles]] in 2014 to join a base called the &quot;[[Kool Kids Klub]]&quot;, where he helped build the largest gold farm on the server. When the base was discovered, Fit fled, and returned to a spawn base of his, where he began experimenting with powered flight, making the first successful flying machine and later the first flyover of spawn.

Following this, he was approached by [[Sato]], who invited him to [[Asgard II]] . After [[Oremonger]] was given coords to Asgard II by a leaker, the members of Asgard II griefed their own base to make sure no other player would have the satisfaction. When the coordinates were leaked and [[Spawn Incursions|the third incursion]] began, Fit joined the team at [[Wrath Outpost]] and fought in the incursion. After it's conclusion, Fit traveled by flying machine far out in [[the End]] and set up &quot;the DFC&quot;, an outpost for travelers, which he abandoned when he learned that Mojang planned to extend the End. Afterwards, Fit moved to [[Aureus City]] , began farming gold, and began searching for ruins on 2b2t. He also griefed some spawnbases or whatever was associated with the [[Imp Base|Imps]] on Jan 3rd, 2016 alongside [[Babbaj]] and [[Jared2013]] .

=== Rusher War ===
When [[the Rusher War|the Rusher Invasion]] began in the summer of 2016, Fit, in collaboration with Sato, created [[Team Veteran]] as a means to oppose the Rusher onslaught. It was a plan to both control a portion of the mass onslaught of new players but also lay a trap for an eventual betrayal by oldfags. However this betrayal attempt did not go over as planned, as Fit was eventually became shunned for many of his oldfag peers for &quot;selling out&quot; and collaborating with TheCampingRusher for the sake of perpetuating Youtube Minecraft-roleplay drama.

During the course of the war, he began to rise to fame as he started to post several videos about 2b2t on his personal youtube channel, either showing montages of him killing Rushers, advertising Team Veteran, or doing base tours and history videos. By the end of the war, his fame was becoming larger than expected and due to this rise in popularity, many Veterans began to think that Fit was becoming somewhat soft towards his newfag subscribers, who the Veterans intended to backstab once the war was over with. Because of his YouTube success, many people began labeling him a &quot;jewtubber&quot;.

=== Post-War ===

Fit declared the Rusher War officially over on October 9th, 2016, and put [[Team Veteran]] to rest.

On November 10th, 2016, he went to [[the End]] to prepare for the 1.11 update on 2b2t, before the great rush for shulker boxes starts. He eventually returned to the overworld on December 7th, 2016, during the chaos of [[Spawn Incursions|the Fifth Incursion]].

He declared a short resurrection of [[Team Veteran]] as a reaction to a French Youtuber with 600,000 subscribers named [[AgentGB]], who joined 2b2t and showcased the server on his channel. However, in response to the large amounts of hate that he was receiving, AgentGB mentioned that he did not intend to create a 2b2t series on his channel and so never created another video. After this, Fit went into a decline on 2b2t, after the Airship Record Stream and the Boat Record Stream. During this time, he quickly logged onto 2b2t and said: &quot;If you disliked 2b2t in June 2016, you're going to dislike it even more in June 2017.&quot;

In January 2017, he returned to the server to kill some Newfags in Spawn, and tour random monuments.

He also had a positive reaction to [[AntVenom]] 's idea of joining the server. He states that Ant is more respectful of the server, unlike Rusher who came into 2b2t without notice.

On February 25th, 2017, he started to construct a new, entirely underground base, without showing any bedrock, but two days later it was found by [[ChromeCrusher]] anyway. He attacked fit while he was livestreaming, but he was unable to kill him. In that point the base was only a giant hole in the ground, so fit didn't lose too much.

Later, on March 3rd, he tried to establish another, even safer base, this time in the sky, so no naturally generated terrain is shown. Eventually he invited [[AlphaComputer]] and [[ChromeChrusher]] (it has been speculated, that Fit did that so Chrome wouldnt find it later and grief it like the other base incident).

During March, he toured the freshly griefed [[Wintermelon]], and made a clickbait video about the Apocalypse Exploit, declaring the &quot;end of 2b2t&quot;.

On April 4th, he started his journey to the World Border, through the [[+X Axis Highway|+X nether highway]]. He arrived to [[Point Nemo]], in April 24th, and several former diggers, including [[Byrnsy]] gathered, to celebrate his arrival. Later some people blamed him, for generating too much attention around the place, which may have caused the new wave of griefing in [[Point Nemo]].

On May 18th, another drama involving Fit, broke out as he visited the diggers secret base, [[Point Dory]], without their permission. In the very same video he announced, that he'll go back to spawn, feeding the speculations, and panic about June 1st. Fit went on to join the [[Spawn Masons]] a day later.[[File:KEK.PNG|thumb|220x220px|Fit meets Rusher in real life. And so the torch passes on for Fit to become the next Rusher.]]
After June 1st, with Rusher not returning to 2b2t, Fit made a memorial video about the War like many other people did at the time.

He is currently doing pretty much the same livestreams and videos that he has been doing before June 1st, like his Alpha gameplay series, his 1.12 series, 2b2t vids, etc. However, now heHe has currently attended Vidcon 2017 and made a video about it as a 150K subscriber special. He also met Rusher in real life during the trip, showing that things settled between the two. Fit claimed that Rusher was one of the parts that caused his YouTube success.

== Relationships ==
* [[TheCampingRusher]] - TheCampingRusher is Fit's archenemy. Ever since the Rusher War began, Fit and Rusher had a tense rivalry. This rivalry would also go further out than 2b2t, an example of which is when Fit was streaming his Server Crash Series, and joins TheArchon as an attempt to ruin Rusher while he is recording a factions episode. This led to TheCampingRusher banning him on TheArchon. However, as of 2017, Fit claims that they are on good terms now. This was proven at Vidcon 2017 when Fit visited Rusher in real life.
* [[Sato86]] - Fit views Sato as a good friend and was the person who invited Fit to Asgard II. He was introduced to Fit by James_Rustles and fought with him during the Third Incursion. During the Rusher War, Fit trains under Sato to simulate 2b2t PvP situations in a private server.
* [[NedaT]] - Fit was originally hostile to NedaT, until they engaged in a duel, in which Fit won and gained respect for her. They also fought with each other during the Biggest Battle in 2b2t History.
* [[Offtopia]] - Fit and Offtopia have a complicated friend-enemy relationship. They were friends during the Third Incursion and the Rusher War, until the Torogadude Incident and Rusher responded in a video. Rusher claimed that he and Fit had a partnership and Fit gave him the coords to the [[Crystal Islands]] , something Offtopia built. Offtopia felt betrayed and angered, he blocked FitMC from all social media and all ways of contacting him. Fit wanted to fix their relationship, especially since he said he never leaked the Crystal Islands to Rusher. Fit tried all ways, and eventually he stumbled upon Offtopia's drain. He wanted to ask if he can tour the base, but since Offtopia blocked him, he was not able to. He toured the base and put a sign to patch things up between them. He later gave up on trying to resolve the conflict and ultimately became enemies with Offtopia.On February 4th, 2018 Fit and some others griefed Viper Base, officially an end of the rivalry that they had since the end of the Rusher War. However, everybody knows it was just for YouTube views.
* [[ChromeCrusher]] - Chrome was the first one to find Fitlantis thanks to a new dupe exploit, and was able to destroy Fit's 2017 Underground Base while in construction. However, they seem to be good friends again, as Chrome now bases with Fit in his skybase.
* [[2F4U]] - Fit hates 2F4U, likely for the distribution of the Xdolf client which is a major contributor to the Future client which Fit is a fanboy of.

== Drama ==
[[File:Hqdefault (2)-0.jpg|thumb|213x213px|This picture shows the theorized (turned out to be true) face of FitMC. It was leaked as Fit, during one of his streams, accidently showed a map art with this image on it. The original map was made by the Reich.]]
During the war, however, people began to conspire against Fit that he was in kahoots with Rusher. Evidence to this is the fact that Rusher proposed a deal to work with FitMC. This deal was that Fit would provide Rusher with coords to bases and that Rusher would promote his channel. Eventually, his youtube channel began to grow and he gained 77,000 subscribers at the end of the Rusher War. This lead to many people believing Fit to be a sellout. Offtopia believed that Fit gave Rusher the coords to the Crystal Islands but Fit denied this by stating that it was a random person who leaked the coords to Rusher by DMing him on twitter. The second conspiracy is that Fit is becoming a second Rusher as his fanbase continues to grow and brings more people to the server. This conspiracy made several oldfags turn against Team Veteran as he was becoming the exact thing that they were fighting against. When Fit returned to 2b2t on January 2017, he stated that most of these people are just remaining Rushers and people who hate him.
[[File:Fitthreat.png|thumb|238px|Fit admitting to having 2F4Us dox, personally hating him, as well as wishing the [[2b2t subreddit]] to be closed.]]
Fit has also been proven to team up with [[Hausemaster]] to remove lag machines. There were many instances where Fit was about to join and then the server either restarted or an existing lag disappeared.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1270">Fitlantis was the base of [[FitMC]] and was his first solo base since 2014. It was discovered using the coordinate exploit of late 2016 by [[ChromeCrusher]] (who did not grief it) and subsequently griefed by a large group of random people. There was also a fight that occurred during the grief between the many random people and [[Team Aurora ]] members. On April 21st, 2017, the base was completely flooded and buried under a series of lavacasts. Fit has the entire construction process of Fitlantis on his [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHZ986wm_sJT6wntdDTIIcw youtube channel] and filmed it via stream.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="682">The Flatlands are the sections of land that surround [[spawn]] . They start out at 10,000 and usually end until 30,000-40,000. The Flatlands are usually generated with alpha chunks and beta chunks, but also have chunks generated by more recent versions. Despite their name, Flatlands usually have normal Minecraft terrain.

It is very common to find abandoned bases in the Flatlands. While these ruins do not usually contain anything extremely valuable, they usually may contain items that could be useful to players who have escaped spawn. It is not advised to set up a long-term base in the Flatlands due to it being somewhat close to spawn.

Flyinqq is a player who was not very known until [[the Rusher War]] . He originally joined the server in December 2015 and was active until the uprising of new players in early 2018, late January - early February to be precise.

He is an infamous player, he is known for his bigotry and his time at the spawn area. He is one of the &quot;[[Spawnfags]] &quot; maybe the most well known next to iTavux

Flyinqq, along with [[Crystalinqq ]] or Crystallising, made a group known as [[Team Coca Cola]] at the date of January 3rd 2017, which was later disbanded at the date of September 11 2017, respectively.

Flyinqq was one of the few people with access to a very small &quot;backdoor&quot; if you would call it in 2017, if one was to message Flyinqq while entering a nether portal he would gain coords to the exit portal of which they come out from, this was shortly patched shortly before[[ AntVenom]] made his 2b2t video. He was also one of the few people with access to a Nether Roof Exploit in 2017.

One of Flyinqq's only public bases that is known of is Shelter 404. It was a group base he lived in alongside members of [[Team Coca Cola]] , he was one of the 12 people who resided at the base, alongside: Crystalinqq, Niftyrobo, Caines_Law, Colette3211, xvideosman, [[Barrendome|BarrenDome]] , TheCookCola, DemonCrown, HappinessBot, XZRC and MiningMinecraft

Flyinqq wasn't really public when it came to teams, as in his almost 3 years of playing he was only teams for a combined time of 10 months, [[Team Coca Cola]], [[Emperium]] and[[ Team Imperia]].

Many people feared Flyinqq because of his advanced knowledge of the End Crystal PvP combat system, he practiced for many hours per day, some say he was one of the best, if not the best End Crystal PvPers on the server. He has claimed the heads of many players, such as: [[Torogadude]] , [[FitMC]] , [[IHackedWalmart]] , [[iTavux]] , [[http_logan]] , [[jared2013]] , [[HermeticLock]] , [[PopularMMOs]] , [[AntVenom]] , [[P529]] , [[NedaT]] , [[Tim_Mcnukepants]] , [[Tumorous]] , [[Sun_Wukon ]] and [[0xymoron]] .

&lt;--- [[The 4Chan Period]]

---&gt; [[Great Server Decay]][[File:2b2t_Timeline_(1).png|thumb]]

The Forum Massacre Period is the second section of history on 2b2t. It started when Facepunchers came to the server after finding out about it after Chezhead saw George and Hause's 2b2t post, who then posted more about it on the Facepunch forums. Due to the chaos of the server (mainly stemming from the 4channers), the Facepunchers decided to start a republic to bring order to the server.

The Forum Massacre Period was most notorious for Popbob's reign of terror, which saw the first [[Backdoors|backdoor]] the server witnessed. Popbob, being a facepuncher (not part of the republic), also gave access to his backdoor to several other of his fellow facepunchers (i.e. xcc2), which allowed for the supplies to build the period's most notable and iconic towns (i.e. [[Ziggy Town]] and [[Plugin Town]]).
[[File:Jtgow5vke16y.png|thumb|220x220px|Oldfags, who we still see today, that joined during this time]]
While the Facepunchers were building their bases and battling 4channers, Offtopia and THEJudgeHolden founded [[The Judge's Group|The Judge's Group.]] This group was the pioneer of group bases, most known being [[Oldtown]]. They were also the first players to ever make it to 1 million blocks away from Spawn. Judge also made a comic about 2b2t called 1 Million.

The Facepunch Era ended in February of 2012 when the Facepunch Republic disbanded, kicking off the Facepunch Decay Era.

== Information From Sato86 ==
&quot;This is where everything changed. This period made 2b2t widely popular among Minecraft players. It all started when a Facepuncher called Chezhead rallied other Minecraft players from the same forum to join him on the server to make a ‘Facepunch Republic’. The short-term goal was just to have a base for the Facepunch community to play on. However, the 4channers took notice of this. Days later, Camp Facepunch, their first base, was destroyed.

On one side, we had the Facepunchers: fairly organized, with a leader and minor leaders. On the other side: 4channers, not organized, no leader and no base. Suddenly the Facepunchers saw themselves at war with an enemy they could not attack, and even worse, that could be anyone around them. 4channers started to infiltrate the forum and ask for coordinates for the bases there, passing themselves as Facepunchers. The pressure on Chezhead was enormous.

Each base they built was destroyed to a point that the facepunchers had to adapt. Chezhead, being caught in the middle of the chaos of what became his republic initiative, lost leadership power to others. This would actually make things a little less worse. With now more heads leading the players, they had more chance to survive. Policemike and Assassin_Raptor were among those that rallied players from Facepunch to make bases. Chezhead abandoned the idea of the republic weeks later. They would keep naming their bases as &quot;Fort”, “Outpost” and “Camp&quot;

Nevertheless, even with the new leadership, they still faced the same troubles. Infiltration was only one of them. 4channer griefers started to stalk facepunch bases on the map, being able to find them without even needing coordinates. Stalkers such as Luke2thebun and sequel soon became infamous.

However, it was at this Era that something remarkable happened. A group of players started to form. These players were not interested in the conflict, but only to make a name for themselves. They had no idea that their acts would actually change the servers’ ways. They received many names: Judge’s group, 1mil base and Chris’s group.

How did they change things? Simply by not giving a damn about what was happening. Judge helped new players at spawn with his base called Oldtown. Offtopia would also often rescue new players at spawn, giving them food. They did not care if they were Facepunchers or 4channers. Actually, the group that later formed would have people from both the factions as well as people from neither of them.

They started to gain not only respect, but hate by both sides as a result - more respected than hated, however. It was also at this time that 2b2t’s first legends appeared, such as Chris and popbob - as well as Judge with his comic - Omalymix and xcc2. And also many others.&quot;

== Trivia ==
* Most bases were usually towns or camps, unlike today where we have cities.
* Popbob was playing on the server at this time, but wasn't a griefer yet.
* Almost all Facepunch bases have been lost to time, and the coordinates are still unknown

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1553">[[File:Unnamed.jpg|thumb|PopularMMOS Profile Picture]]

FuriousDestroyer (Also known as PopularMMOS, with his real name being Patrick Brown) is a famous minecraft youtuber that has over 10 million subscribers. His videos nowadays mostly consist of modded challenges (Like mob battles). He started making videos back in May 2012, although these videos were on Runescape (hence his youtube name). His first minecraft related content was posted on June 2012, in the form of a let's play. 

==Relationship with 2b2t==
In early April, PopularMMOS joined [[2b2t]] a couple of times. He was quickly spotted, and many believed that he was going to make a video about 2b2t. This would have been catastrophic, as a channel with over 14 million subs would bring a lot more attention to the server than anyone has ever done before. In April 12th, PopularMMOS is seen with [[Golden Apples|God Apples]], Weaponry and armor, and it is still unknown how he was geared up. In a [[2b2t subreddit|Reddit]] post showing concerns of PopularMMOS making a video about the server, [[AntVenom|Antvenom]] responded with: &quot;He told me personally he's probably not making content here&quot;. It has been many months since then, so it is safe to say that PopularMMOS is probably not making a video about 2b2t.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2573">[[File:Untitled4.png|thumb|160x160px]]Georgebush420 is the original and lesser known owner of [[2b2t]]. He continues to own the server with [[Hause]], who has been his long term friend, and works on various plugins for 2b2t. Georgebush was the first person to come up with the idea of 2b2t as it was originally a Garry's mod server.

== History of Server Care ==

=== Gary's Mod Server ===
Back in 2009/2010, Georgebush420 came up with the idea of a server where players could do whatever they wanted with no rules. He created a server on Garry's mod with this premises in mind. Eventually, upon the release of Minecraft multiplayer, georgebush created the minecraft server we know today as 2b2t.

=== Transition To Minecraft ===
In December of 2010, georgebush created 2b2t with the same premises as the Garry's Mod server.

=== Hausemaster ===
Hausemaster is a friend of georgebush420 and was invited by George to co-run the server as Hause's computer has better processing and downloading speeds to care for the server. Hausemaster currently does most major things, but is most likely aided by George behind the scenes. This is why Hausemaster is much more known throughout the community than George, who is mainly known by oldfags and those who dig deep in 2b's history.

=== Behind The Scenes ===
[[File:Capture-1499625894.PNG|thumb|220x220px|The many plugins of 2b2t]]
It has been confirmed that George mainly creates special plugins for the server. With this in mind, it could be assumed that George was responsible for the original [[queue]] system. He also helps Hause when switching from old maps to tempmaps, and vice versa. Proof of this was when georgebush420 was seen to be the only player online during the switch from 2016's tempmap back to the old map. He may be helping Hause with new plugins for 1.12. 
[[File:T57o4M7.png|thumb|220x220px|Georgebush seen online during switch between tempmape and oldmape in 2016]]

== Trivia ==
* It is assumed that georgebush420 lives in Sweden because 2b2t is hosted in Stockholm, Sweden, and he knows Hausemaster in real life, who lives in sweden.
* Hausemaster is known to have access to GeorgeBush420's account, as discovered during the [[Backdoors|third backdoor]].[[File:1370980067.png|thumb|220x220px|Vintage picture of server statistics from facepunch thread showing where server is hosted]]
* Some people theorize that George is the same as [[Hause]], but the vast majority of the community knows that they are different people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4906">== Golden Apples ==
Golden Apples, specifically Enchanted Golden Apples, also known as Gapples, Notch Apples, or God Apples, are a commonly used item on 2b2t, the prevalence of which is a consequence of 2b2t’s long, exploit-riddled history.

== History ==
Golden apples have both a complicated version history and server history. Golden apples were originally added before alpha, crafted with an apple and 8 golden blocks, and when eaten would completely restore a player’s health. When 2b2t began, this was the state golden apples were in.

In beta 1.8, in late 2011, when food was made to restore hunger instead of health, they were changed so that they gave players the regeneration effect for 30 seconds rather than just an instant health increase. In 1.1, in early 2012, they were nerfed so that they restored less health and hunger, but were easier to craft, using golden nuggets instead of blocks. The much more powerful enchanted golden apples, which provided the regeneration, resistance, and fire resistance effects, were added in 1.3, in mid-2012, bringing back something similar to the old style of golden apples alongside the lesser, more easily obtained variant. It was a little while after this, in early 2013, that the original minecart [[Duplication Glitches|dupe]] was used to duplicate large amounts of enchanted golden apples for the first time.

In 1.6, enchanted golden apples were tweaked so that they gave a more powerful regeneration effect and the absorption effect. And it was about a year after this that the [[Kool Kids Klub]] was founded. The Kool Kids Klub began in 2014 as little more than a small group base that happened to be really far away from spawn, but as more and more players were invited to build there, they began to develop plans for bigger things. Eventually they began building what would be, and still is, the biggest gold farm ever built on 2b2t.

Back then, the main use for gold was hoarding it so you could make enchanted golden apples with it, and maybe some regular golden apples, golden carrots, and glistering melons while you were at it. By building a gold farm that could pump out thousands of gold blocks’ worth of nuggets and ingots per hour, the members of the Kool Kids Klub were able to approximately quadruple the amount of enchanted golden apples on the server within a relatively short amount of time. And through trading, donations, and theft, these golden apples were distributed to many other players on the server, making them more readily available than they had been before.

Later, in 2015, long after the Kool Kids Klub had been found and destroyed, Mojang announced that the next update, 1.9, would change golden apples yet again, this time making the enchanted variant an uncraftable treasure item. Once this was announced, most of 2b2t’s players spent the next several months until the update came out furiously building gold farms, farming oak trees, and doing whatever they could in order to obtain as many enchanted golden apples as they could possibly ever need. This resulted in the amount of enchanted golden apples on 2b2t to skyrocket by an even larger amount.

By the time [[The Rusher War]] began, most of the regular players had huge stockpiles of golden apples, which, alongside the fact they all had enchanted diamond armor, made them very difficult for [[Team Rusher|Rushers]] to kill in combat, even once the rushers had enchanted diamond gear themselves. However, when the minecart dupe was discovered by the [[the Resistance|Resistance]], they and other Rusher subgroups were able to dupe, among many other things, enchanted golden apples, and the [[Team Veteran|Veterans]] used the dupe to increase their supplies of golden apples as well. This made the two sides of the war increasingly evenly matched, and made their battles tend to last much longer.

End crystals were also duplicated en masse at the same time, and when [[Suicide Bombing (Crystal/Bed Bombing)|crystal bombing and bed bombing]] became popularized during the late stages of the Rusher war, enchanted golden apples became an even more important asset than they had been, since having recently eaten an enchanted golden apple was the only way for players to survive close-range crystal detonations, even if they were wearing enchanted diamond armor.

Later dupes, such as the [[11/11 Dupe|11/11 dupe]], cactus dupe, [[Donkey Dupe|donkey dupe]], llama dupe, and crafting book dupe, once again enabled players to make enchanted golden apples. Golden apples were prioritized for duplication in all of these events due to their normal rarity and extreme usefulness. Today, while it remains hard for new players to obtain more than a few enchanted golden apples, should you discover a dupe stash or join a group of more experienced players, anyone can get a golden apple stockpile of their own.

'''Goodwill Trading &amp; Associates''', or simply Goodwill Trading, is a [[trade]] group with the purpose to collect and sell items, books, maps, banners, and everything else that makes 2b2t special. The group is a pioneer in trading services, post Rusher War, and is the only active '''group''' on the server that exists for the sole purpose of trading. The group tends to remain neutral and sells to any customer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2879">'''[http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline Timeline of 2b2t]'''

&lt;--- [[Forum Massacre Period]]

&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;---&gt; [http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/First_Valkyrian_Period First Valkryian Period][[File:00-ImageMain (2).png|thumb|220x220px]]
The Great Server Decay started when the Facepunch Republic started to lose control and eventually collapsed. This along with server lag problems, the IP change from .net to .org, and the server being down for three months caused many players to quit 2b2t. The Facepunch Decay Era is most well known for its all time low player count. Due to the lack of players, griefings and battles became less common, creating a twisted version of peace, basically completing the Facepunch initiative in an ironic way. This Era does not have much history due to the low player count.... until 2b2t was switched to a temporary map to test plugins. On this map, Hitlerwood, the remnants of the Facepunch Republic, teamed up with many other small groups to form Valkyria. 

== Notable Events ==
[[File:JoWTd45-0.png|thumb|220x220px]]
* Facepunchers started to form their own groups or just going solo. 4channers had nothing more to destroy or stalk, seeing themselves to be forced to follow the same path of their enemies. 2b2t base numbers grew at the same pace that the griefings decreased. The player number also started to decrease due the fact that many players gave up after the extremely violent period. 1mil group or at least what was left from it was isolated in the millions.

* A very long Era of decay began. It started with a new facepunch thread that was made about 2b2t - during February 2012 - announcing that there was no republic and that there had never been one. In fact, the amounts of bases that were made claiming to be facepunch republics would be so great that even dirt huts would make this claim as a obvious joke of the whole situation. 

* During June 2012, 2k2k became the only official facepunch base to be discussed on the forums. Phagocyitc was the person in the charge of the base. The fact that the place was considered a spawn base and griefed before would discourage 4channers to do anything. They would just repair it again and again. Both sides were exhausted from the months of fighting.

* 2b2t griefings became more and more rare. The lag started to strike and many players left the server. The last attempt by Facepunchers to make a base was lead by Coldwave and his group. However they were smart enough to avoid the mistakes of their predecessors. The group had a locked list of invited members. No one on the forum would join, no matter how much they asked. They would use facepunch to update their base progress and communicate. They greatest base was known as Hitlerwood

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1032">&quot;Greetings From Baghdad&quot; was a chat meme popularized during the [http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/Age_of_Hype &quot;Age of Hype&quot; ] and used primarily to aggravate a group of rushers that went by the name &quot;[[The Resistance]]&quot;. It was designed to simultaneously mock naked spawn bombers and the Muslim extremist groups' tendency to suicide-bomb soft targets.  

[[File:Baghdad.jpg|thumb|283x283px]]

It also references a mid-distance operations base along the -z Highway that was constructed during the [[4th incursion]] over top of a double grinder. The meme was primarily invoked after someone had been Crystal'd. This method of pvp became popular along with bed bombing for its ability to one hit a fully geared non-blast protection player before they had time to gapple up. It was very effective around spawn due to the amount of obsidian used in constructing major walkways. 

Obsidian was primarily used for overworld transit due to its extremely high blast resistance.

Known for being widespread across 2b2t, groups are an association of players with a shared goal among the group. Groups vary from being buildmates/basemates to a group of griefers. Some groups are also known for being incredibly autistic. Groups on 2b2t also have the unique oddity where members of one group can be apart of another, meaning that groups can have overlapping members.

== List of Groups ==

=== Facepunch Era Groups ===
* [[Facepunch Republic]]
* [[4channers|4Channers]]
* [http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/The_Judge%27s_Group Judge's group]
* [[Brotherhood of the Diamond]]

=== Cancerous Groups ===
* [[Team Pepsi]]
* [[Team Coca Cola]]
* [[The Peacekeepers]]
* [[Team Topkek]]

=== Base Groups ===
* [[Valkyria]]
* [[The Legion of Shenandoah]]
* [[The Vortex Coalition]]
* [[DonFuer]]

=== Age of Hype Groups ===
* [[Team Veteran]] - one of the major belligerents during [[The Rusher War]]. It was formed in June 2016 by a player named [[Fit]] to stop the Rusher threat on the server.
* [[Team Rusher]] - one of the major belligerents during The Rusher War. It was formed in June 2016 by [[TheCampingRusher]]. It is ambiguous and refers to both the team and its members, TheCampingRusher's fanbase.
* [[The 4th Reich]] - a griefing group created by [[Tim McNukepants]], the 4th Reich is popular for griefing many bases during the Rusher War.
* [[Team Aurora]] -  a group formed by NedaT&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt; and xPandaMCx. Originally used as a way to make allies on 2b2t, the group eventually added the likes of PvP_ComboZ, Jonpue, &lt;/span&gt;Brayin&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;and&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:400;&quot;&gt; Chloe and took place in the battle against the 4th Reich and Peacekeepers. Pro-Vet during the Rusher War.&lt;/span&gt;
* [[The Resistance]] - a group led by CorruptedUnicorn, originally for him and his friends. The Resistance mainly allied themselves with Team Rusher until the Biggest Battle of 2b2t, where Corrupted joined Fit.
* [[Peacekeepers]] - The Peacekeepers was originally the idea of a third side in the war, a neutral side.
* The Fourth Incursion Army - The Fourth Incursion Army was organized by [[Sato86]] against the Resistance and the flood of Newfags in [[Spawn]]. It is often misthought as a part of Team Veteran, however the two entities are completely different.

The Guardian Rushers were a [[Team Rusher]] sub group composed of diamond Junefags created by [[TheJadyha]] . It was supposed to act as the &quot;elite&quot; Rusher sub group. The group's goal was to help their fellow Newfags escape spawn, create [[sanctuaries]] , honor and protect [[monuments]] , and to kill [[Team Veteran|Veterans]] . It also unintentionally acted as a diplomatic group as they have interacted with several other groups such as the [[Vortex Coalition]] and the [[Resistance]] .

== History ==
The group was started by TheJadyha, a fanatical Rusher, on July 19th, 2016, when he posted a Rusher propaganda video. He made the group after he tried several times to get [[TheCampingRusher]] 's attention (who pretty much ignored him lol) and this was probably another attempt. The group succeeded in several of their goals during [[the Rusher War ]] as they have helped several Rushers escape spawn and have created sanctuaries.

Towards the end of the War, when [[NedaT]] was kicked out of the Resistance, the group began getting criticism as TheJadyha had been friends with Neda and still is. When Neda T created [[Team Aurora]] , a Pro-Veteran group, TheJadyha had still interacted with her, which made several Rushers mad with TheJadyha as he was aiding the enemy. Eventually, he made a video about the criticism and stated that the Guardian Rushers will remain neutral with Team Aurora and that if they attack Rushers, then they will be attacked by the Guardian Rushers. During the Rusher's first departure period, TheJadyha began to claim that he was taking leadership of the Rushers. However, he was denied this by the rest of the Rushers as the group belongs to TheCampingRusher.

During the Rusher Era's last 5 days, TheJadyha eventually left Team Rusher on October 17th, 2016, in order to create his own group, disbanding the group with his departure. This was due to his fans telling him to leave Team Rusher and to create his own group and that he was getting too much criticism from his interactions with NedaT.

== Relations ==
* Since the group was a [[Team Rusher]] sub group, their alliances, neutrality, and enmity with other groups were the same as Team Rusher.
* Team Aurora - Team Aurora was the only exception to the information above as they were enemies with Team Rusher. This was because of TheJadyha's friendly actions towards the group. Eventually, due to criticism, the sub group became neutral with Team Aurora.

== Notable Members ==
* TheJadyha (leader)
* Noblethread
* LandonMC
* Rkt898

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1162">The gulag was a series of slave camps typically made at 0,0 nether and overworld that was used during the [[Spawn Incursions|Sixth Incursion]]. These could be considered to be the FOB's of the Sixth Incursion. At the camps the Incrusion members would capture new players (typically AntVenom fans due to the abundance of them) and make them break ender chests in order to get obsidian. If they didn't comply they were killed on the spot. The obsidan was then used to make the Incursion wall around spawn.

[[File:BrokenWall.png|thumb|220x220px|The incursion wall after being greifed several times, posted on subreddit.]]

== Trivia ==
* This was the first known time in server history where slave labor was used on a community project
* New players were sometimes given help for the work they did
* The wall was originally used to keep the new players trapped in [[Spawn]], but didn't work very well as new players could tunnel under and over the wall
* The wall likely couldn't have been completed without the slaves' help

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3469">Hacked items are items that have been hacked in by various backdoors, exploits, glitches, and things of that nature. Some of these items have a purpose, others don't. Regardless, most of these items are considered valuable by the general population. Some of these items are even exclusive to 2b2t, as some of these items will never be seen on any other Minecraft server, which truly enhances 2b's uniqueness.
[[File:Maxresdefault-3.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Stacked Armor]]
These items will be listed with a rarity based on how hard they are able to find or attain:

Harblax was a [[Facepunchers|Facepuncher]] that converted to the [[4channers]] out of sheer boredom. Harblax is especially famous for his bases, mostly consisting of labyrinthian man made caves with almost no rooms. Harblax was just the average Facepuncher during 2011, but in 2012 he griefed 3 bases and was exiled. Harblax quit [[2b2t]] in 2013-2014, and it seems like he has gained an interest for games like DOTA 2, as can be seen from his [https://www.reddit.com/user/Harblax/ Reddit]account.

&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;HardHat's Pyramid is an insane build (as in crazy insane not wow insane) built by, you guessed it, HardHat. The pyramid is known for its strange design and being very close to [[Imp Base]]. 
[[File:FD9hGCng.png|thumb|220x220px]]

== History ==
{{2B2T_Build_Template|status = Destroyed|players_who_live(d)_here = HardHat, several other travelers|approx_date_construction_began = Sometime in 2013|approx_date_finished = Sometime in 2013 (Possibly 2014)|builder(s) = HardHat|approx_date_leaked = October 14th, 2016|leaker = Lifeisgood72|approx_date_demolished = October 14th 2016|demolishers = Lifeisgood72|realm = Overworld|coordinates = (X: -1,000,000 Z: -1,000,000)}}While the exact date of its completion is unknown, the base was most likely built sometime in 2013. HardHat's intention of building it was simply to leave his legacy on the server and so he made the long trek to where the base currently resides. Several travelers to Imp's base have discovered it on their way there and have left the usual sign to state that they were there. Some even dedicated themselves to protect the base. HardHat would continue to come on for about a year but kept under the radar and eventually left.

The original base was griefed on October 14th, 2016 by [[Lifeisgood72]], around the end of the [[The Rusher War|Rusher War]], however, it was rebuilt in a different location.

[[File:R2Pho65g.png|thumb|220x220px]]

== Architecture ==
''&quot;Insanity is often described as doing the same thing over and over again, and on 2b2t, making builds can drive a builder insane.&quot;''

-Fit, July 14th, 2016

HardHat's pyramid is a very strange and unique build. It is probably one of the most odd looking pyramids ever created in Minecraft. The base is made with lines upon lines of stone brick that all join together at squares with holes in the middle. The base goes like this all the way to the top, making the base look like something out of an optical illusion. The base is perfectly symmetrical all the way and with the same patterns repeated over and over again. This lead other players to the fact that HardHat was borderline insane if not fully. The pyramid does not have a tip but rather a large gap between all four points, leading down through the holes below.
[[File:Capture-1493504842.PNG|thumb|220x220px]]
The base also included an underground hub where items with common living spaces and storage. Signs were often put here.

== Trivia ==
* The base is located directly on the diagonal axis from spawn. With this in mind, it is also directly aligned with [[2k2k]].
* While the base was built near Imp Base, HardHat was not part of Imps and was completely coincidental that it was near it. It is also reachable by the same highway towards Imp's.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14788">[[File:Hausemaster 2d.png|thumb|220x220px|Hause's skin]]Hausemaster is one of the owners of 2b2t, along with [[Georgebush420]], and owns the entire memory of 2b2t. He has been the owner since the start of the server in 2010 and he is obviously one of the oldest ancientfags ever. Hause does not have to worry too much about the server as a normal server owner, as owning an anarchy server means that he does not have to worry about hiring admins, adding stuff to the server, moderating chat, banning people, or really doing anything except making sure the server remains playable.

{{2B2T_Player_Template|title1 = HauseMaster|approx_join_date = December of 2010 (One Of The Oldest Oldfags Alive and Active (to a degree))|status = Inactive (unless on cocaine)|known_alternates = [[georgebush420]] (possibly has access to the account)|reddit_username = 2builders2tools|current_affiliation(s) = N/A (Possibly the Jews at Wall Street)|past_affiliation(s) = N/A}}

== History of Server Care ==
Hause has done a relatively good job of taking care of the +3500 GB worth of memory server by continuously updating its minecraft version, preventing the deletion of the original map, and paying the monthly $90 for the server's rent in which he pays for with his own money or donations from the community. If Hause fails to pay that $90 at the end of the month, the server actually shuts down forever, causing the end of the 2b2t world (unless he makes a new map). Currently, only 1 player corruption has happened on the server where everyone lost their items, but this was early in the server's history when not many valuable items had been added yet, due to the the fact that Minecraft was still in the Alpha and Beta stages. Hause has also given maintenance to the server several times in order to fix lag or issues with the 7+ year old server, usually causing the server to become unavailable for variable time spans. The most severe time that the server was down was during the [[Great Server Decay]] when the server was down for three months. During this time, Hause changed the original IP of the server from 2b2t.net to 2b2t.org which caused several people to believe the server shut down for good.
=== Temp Maps ===
[[File:JB0T30ie.jpg|thumb|220x220px]]
Temp maps are temporary maps made by Hause, usually to update and modify the old map. The server has had 4 temp maps so far, the first being at the end of the [[Great Server Decay]] in 2013, the second being 3b3t in early 2015, the third being during the early stages of [[The Rusher War]] during [[Age of Hype|the Age of Hype]] in 2016, and the fourth being in the summer of 2017.

The 1st map was made in order for Hause to fix the massive lag on the old map during the Great Server Decay. The 2nd was in order to format the old map to Anvil format when the world height was increased to it's current limit. The 3rd was to add the queue system during the insane flood of new players and fix lag issues. The 4th has been added in order to test new plugins for the server in preparation of 2b2t's update to 1.12.

=== Minecraft Dimensions On 2b2t ===
(''For more information see [[the Nether]] and [[the End]])''

WIP

=== Patches and Game Breaking Rules ===
The only &quot;rules&quot; that Hause has added to the server is that it is illegal to use game breaking tools that make the game unfair. He has added plugins to cause people using insane speed hacks and fly hacks to be kicked from the server. He has also patched several Dupe glitches, Backdoors, and other hack based glitches (i.e. Bed TP). Hause has been known to have actually used MC Edit in order to get rid of ridiculous lag machines and illegally placed bedrock, and once removed a giant wall around spawn (which ironically happened not long before rusher joined). Despite all this, he does let players keep duplicated items and usually takes his sweet long time patching things, causing players to be able to squeeze as much as they can out of glitches.

Hause has currently patched only one thing related to Vanilla Minecraft that does not involve hacking or glitches. This patch was for frost walker, an enchantment added in 1.10 Minecraft Update, in which several players used to freeze up entire rivers, builds with water, and even oceans.

Another object that has received plenty of attention is the elytra due to players finding glitches and hacks to cause infinite flight. Eventually, Hausemaster patched the first elytra glitch during the summer of 2016 (when elytras were first added) and the second during the time period of the 5th Incursion. The third glitch, which used an exploit in the options provided in the hacked client known as Aristois, was patched on January 23rd, 2017, by Hausemaster as he now officialy &quot;banned&quot; the elytras usage making it the second vanilla item removed from 2b2t (the other being frostwalker).

He also disabled /kill for a time, to prevent the &quot;apocalypse exploit&quot; from being used (whereby a player would kill themselves while passing into the overworld through a nether portal, causing the game to think the player was both at their spawn point and at the overworld side of the portal, forcing the game to load all the chunks between those two locations), but later re-enabled it after patching the exploit.

=== Backdoors and OP account ===
The server has currently been backdoored 3 times. The first backdoor was caused by [[Popbob]] during the early [[Facepunch Republic|Facepunch]] time, which allowed his thunderhack, enchanted blocks, and hacked items, the second by [[iTristan]] and [[Pyrobyte]] to allow for them to reach the world border and create more hacked items, and the third by[[ the Tyranny]], which allowed for insane destruction.

The third backdoor was the most insane to this date. The Tyranny managed to hack the account of [[georgebush420]], the first owner of 2b2t. While many believe this to be illegal IRL because it is theft of property and the access of email accounts from Dark Web sites in fucking China, Hause did not press any charges against iTristan and his cronies. The group used the OP account to destroy several large builds and even to forge super weapons with insane enchantments like lvl 32K sharpness swords, knockback swords that could kick a person for flying, and looting swords that could crash the server by making mobs drop thousands of items at once. This caused an arms race for these weapons around the server until HauseMaster realized that these weapons existed so he returned these weapons back to normal vanilla enchantments. The group also used the account to create player heads of various players.

Hause has managed to patch all these backdoors. He stopped Popbob's Thunder Hack by disabling thunder on 2b2t, and regained his alternate account either by deleting it or changing its password/username.

=== Queue and Rusher Fiasco ===
[[File:Maxresdefault-1.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Current Queue]]
The current [[Queue]] system that has been implemented into 2b2t is the revamped queue suggested by [[TheCampingRusher|Rusher]] . Hause created the original queue to try to control the flooding from Rusher's video, however, it was not the greatest queue system. This caused a lot of people to be angry (especially oldfags), which Rusher noticed. Rusher suggested to Hause that he could buy the server in order to make it lag free, but Hause thankfully declined the offer because 2b2t would arguably be much worse and wouldn't have it's original 'feels'. Rusher then suggested the current queue, which added the Veteran Queue system and Priority queue. Veteran Queue gave the oldfags who joined before June 1st, 2016 a smaller wait time depending on how long ago they actually joined. The Priority Queue offers a smaller wait time than even the Veteran Queue, which you have to pay $20 monthly in order to have. Hause liked the idea and so allowed Rusher and his crew of faction buddies to add and control the queue, which spawned a little hate. This, however, was able to be abused by Rusher, such as when he removed Torogadude off the veteran queue list for being critical of rusher. Fortunately, Torogadude got his queue priority back (at least until veteran queue was removed for everyone), and no one else had their privileges illegitimately revoked. Hausemaster later made a [https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t/comments/4yq20l/2b2t_drama_there_is_none_its_just_a_block_game/ post] about the fiasco, saying that Minecraft is just a block game.

== Language ==
Hausemaster is from sweden, like Georgebush420, and they know each other in real life, as confirmed in the original 2b2t facepunch thread.[[File:Bg7fthsmsqbx.png|thumb|220x220px|Queue from players perspective]]

=== Post-War ===
After the war, Hause would do a few more things such as re-enabling elytras, then disabling them again later, (no) thanks to Fit. He also updated 2b2t to 1.11, which patched the 11/11 dupe. He also patched the Donkey dupe and llama dupe.

=== Miserable Fail ===
On April 25th, 2017, Hausemaster attempted to enable the elytra while using AAC as the server's new anticheat. In that day, over 90 people were kicked, even players that weren't using hacked clients. In the same day, over 100 emails were sent to Hausemaster telling him to remove AAC as there were too many false kicks, but none received a response. The change was later reverted.

=== AAC Re-added ===
After a short time, Hause re-added AAC in early May with a much better update 3.1.6 which reduced the number of disconnects and issues being reported on the server. While [[Hacked Clients|hacked clients]] are still buggy as hell, the raging has slowed down significantly.

=== 1.12 Improvements to server ===
Hause and George have currently been working on new plugins to help improve the overall gameplay of 2b2t. Follow the link below to see all changes and improvements to come:

https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t/comments/6h092r/2b2t_112_update_a_reminder_that_you_are_here/

== Drama ==
Hause has been criticized for directly interfering with the 2b2t world using MC Edit by adding / removing things such as massive lag machines. Hause has also been praised / criticized for adding End Portals to the world. The community of 2b2t likes to joke that Hause doesn't do anything with 2b2t unless he is high on cocaine and that he is a massive jew. Hause has also been notorious for not being involved with the server for long periods of time, letting players do what they wanted (which to some oldfags was a good thing) as well as giving Rusher control of the priority queue system. His game breaking rules are criticized due to the fact that the server is an anarchy server where anything should be possible but has received praise as these glitches and hacks would make the server pointless and not very fun.

== Other Admins ==
While it is generally recognized that Hause is the sole admin (atleast meant to be) on 2b2t, it has been speculated and theorized that there are/were others.
* [[Georgebush420]] - suspected to be an actual person rather than just Hause's alt account
* [[iTristan]] - due to suspicions of possible collusion between Hause and Tristan during 3rd backdoor crisis.
* Other Tyranny Members - It is also possible that Hause gave admin access to other members of the Tyranny, however very unlikely.
* [[Curtis]] - [[Rusher|Rusher's]] little crony who runs the [[queue]] system due to an agreement between Hause and Rusher that the queue would be [[The Archon|Archon]] run during the Rusher War. It is suspected that Curtis possibly has more power than anticipated. These suspicions rise from admin on the [[subreddit]] to even as far as in game control.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2431">HermeticLock is a newfag on 2b2t who is most known for his involvement with [[DonFuer]], creating the &quot;[[World Famous Spawn Base]]&quot;, and being the leader of the [[Spawn Masons|Spawn Mason]] group, and various other projects.

== History ==
HermeticLock joined sometime during the Rusher War and decided to join [[the Vortex Coalition]], achieving the ranks of Developer and Executive. He was a member of the Vortex Coalition up until the third phase of VoCo, known as the &quot;fall of VoCo&quot; in January of 2017. He became involved with the group [[DonFuer]], who were a group that had come from several servers and decided to create their tenth base on 2b2t. Herm helped with the build but it was supposedly leaked by Colt and the base was eventually destroyed. In response, Herm changed the background of the Vortex Coalition website into a DonFuer propaganda page since he was in charge of running it. DonFuer claimed to have defeated VoCo in these propaganda memes. Hermeticlock eventually got ahold of the Vortex Coalition discord after Colt &quot;sold&quot; it to him, which was really a meme.

After the whole drama with VoCo (which was mainly meme), Herm continued to be apart of DonFuer, helping with the planning of the eleventh base. However, the base was never completed and Hermeticlock eventually decided to leave the group. He moved on to create his World Famous Spawn Base, which received a lot of attention by the community that there were visitors almost daily and the third largest battle took place there.

Herm eventually decided to create the [[Spawn Masons]] on the principle that no base will ever last on the server. With this in mind, the Masons would build there bases and upon completion would destroy them. The Masons lasted for seven months until Herm decided to disband the group in order to prevent it from any sort of real drama and for it to wither away. The SpawnMasons decided to reform a few months after it's disbandment. He now continues to play on the server regularly. 

Today, Herm is an executive in VoCo. He has done multiple projects since November 2017, notably Project Shiny and Project Acacia. Hermeticlock was promoted to First Class after his time as Prime Minister. During the Off-Season, Herm wasn't seen much in the discord. However, he became an executive toward the end of the Off-Season. Phase IV has seen Herm return to moderate levels of activity.

The Highland started as idea in late February of 2017, between [[The_Grand_Lotus]] and CasparovJr.  Highland is a community dedicated to providing a better experience for players on 2b2t.  It is an independent group that remains neutral to affairs of other groups. Highland is a safe haven to all new players, a guide to the 2b2t basics.  Players may find equality here acquiring items considered valuable for potential duping.  Members are screened and groomed for selection, chosen by very private standards.  Highland currently has no chat bots, instead, dedicated players spam Highland philosophy.

Many players have come and gone from the Highland, some choosing not to participate, others having that choice made for them. Members of the Highland understand not to become too attached to individual players, as they can stop playing at any time. The overall sense of community is definitely worth being curious about.  The Highland agenda remains classified to the public, but fully intends to continue providing a better experience for players in general.

~ THIS IS THE OFFICIAL STATEMENT PROVIDED BY THE LEADER OF THE HIGHLAND~[[File:HighlandShieldPattern.PNG|thumb|323x323px|Shield Banner]][[File:HighlandBanner.PNG|thumb|316x316px|Banner]]

== Fun Fact! ==
* The group has a role system that starts out with Vassal, proceeding to Highland and then further, private promotions to Sergeant, Chaplain, or Knight. These roles are modeled after the 11th century Templar. The group also has a role for Non-Highland participants, which is a general 2b2t chat available to all players. Voice Channels include 2B2T, Highland, Great Hall, and Round Table.

househousehouse1 is a 2b2t player who joined in June 2016 and has been active on the server for over a year. househousehouse1 is best known for:

- Becoming well known during the rusher era for making low quality bait shitposts on the 2b2t subreddit.

- Creating the 400 400 nether VOID bedrock hole (the second most popular one to this day).

- Creating the 400 400 nether ROOF bedrock hole (most popular one to this day).

- Being in the initial [[+X Digging Group|worldborder group]] with [[Byrnsy]] , Pufferfluffs, and Auion and contributing to [[+X highway]] bases such as [[15 Million Town|15miltown]] .

- Discovering a bed tp exploit that was used for over 2 months before getting leaked and patched.

- Using a lag exploit to bring hell to the 2b2t community over the course of several months, resulting in the loss of many friends for hhh1. The machine used for this has since been removed by [[hausemaster]] .

- Removing water from The Southern Canal with some other [[Vortex Coalition]] member and generally griefing highways.

-Building an extremely high quality dirt hut near spawn which was toured by [[Fit]]

househousehouse1 is largely disliked by the 2b2t community for being an immature fag and lagging the server. Although he is hated by many he has been in several groups such as the [[Spawn Masons]], [[The Vortex Coalition]], Team Mentos, and Splinter/Subgroups of VoCo, like Team Cyber and RULACLAN.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="734">{{Stub}}iTristan is a notorious player on 2b2t who is best known for his extensive knowledge of Java, being involved in two of the three 2b2t [[backdoors]], a notorious griefer and hacker, and a member of several large group bases. iTristan is credited with being one of the smartest players IRL to ever play on 2b2t.

Only player to spawn in and use barrier blocks. His stash was found and duped barrier blocks are rare, unusable and can only be stored in a zombies hand or in a minecart chest thanks to the &quot; disable block&quot; plugin.

iTristan stopped playing after the Tyranny controversy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="519">I just (Fill in Blank) is a common term spammed by either players or [[:Category:Spambot|spambots]]. The phrase refers to common words by newfags that make something minor seem very amazing because they did it on 2b2t (i.e. I JUST PLACED A WOODEN BLOCK!!!!). The phrase has esentially become a meme around the server because players also spam the phrase and find the mocking of newfags humorous.

== Common Use of the phrase ==
* I JUST WALKED # BLOCKS
* I JUST PLACED A (block)
* I JUST ATE A (food)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7037">The Imperator's Base, also known as the Viking Base and the Ungriefable Base, is one of the greatest bases in 2b2t, built by the legendary [[Imperator's group]] . It was home to the greatest build on 2b2t history, the Jesus Statue, and was griefed by [[jared2013]] in 2015. You can download the base [http://www.mediafire.com/file/0e0odawr3bofqb7/2b2t+Imp%27s+Base.zip here][[File:1.png|thumb|220x220px]]{{Space_Valkyria|title1 = Imperator's Base|built = (Started) 2012, (Height) 2013|griefer =jared2013 |dimension = Overworld|destroyed = December 24th-25th 2015 (best Christmas gift EVA!!!)|builder = |builder(s) = [[Imperator's group]]|griefer(s) = [[jared2013]] and a few others (Coords leaked accidently by [[iTristan]]) The description of the grief itself can be found [[Imperator's Base Grief|here]]|coordinates = X: -1,078,035 Y: 65 Z: -1,083,170}}

== History ==
&lt;center&gt;

'''Note: This was written by jared2013 on 2b2t.online who was responsible for griefing the base. Also NO TL;DR this is the history read or don't up to you.'''
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;The world of 2b2t, a place of destruction and fear, where around every corner there is someone - or something - that wants to kill you. A place where many have attempted to survive, and failed miserably. Only those lucky enough to break free from the wasteland that is [[Spawn]] , be it via Nether or Overworld, can survive and prosper here. 2b2t is a place where nothing lasts forever, not even the largest and most far from Spawn. This is a story of one of those bases, Imperator's Base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;Started in 2012 and occupied by the most elite people on 2b2t, Imp's Base was destined for glory. It was made during a time when dupes were plentiful and backdoors were almost always present. The base was named after a famous player who settled the base, ImperatorTerrae. When he arrived at the location, there were several people already living there at their own base, which is sometimes referred to as &quot;Viking Base.&quot; He liked the spot, however, and invited them to stay. Several well-known players such as [[Offtopia]] , [[omallymix]] , [[THEJudgeHolden]] , [[CytotoxicTcell]] , [[xcc2]] , and [[LegitLobster]] were invited. Soon, the base had become a symbol of 2b2t hierarchy and wealth. The base was engraved in 2b2t history as legend when the first pictures of Imperator's Jesus Statue surfaced. Imperator's Base was at its height in power around 2013, after it had been discovered by the infamous griefer known as [[popbob]] . Imperator reasoned with popbob, providing him with an invitation to the base, and popbob gladly accepted. Thus, Imperator's Base was dubbed, &quot;The Ungriefable Base&quot; by many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;However, this good fortune was not to last. By 2014, many of the inhabitants of Imp's had quit and gotten bored of their magnificent structures and vast wealth. With their End Portal removed by [[Hausemaster]] , it was nearly impossible to make contact with anyone on the server except for the global chat. They were isolated. Players like [[iTristan]] and [[Branillon]] received invitations to the base, but had to use accounts already at Imp's because Hausemaster had disabled Nether Roof access. In early 2015, whilst sharing images with other members of a Skype chat, iTristan accidentally posted an image with coordinates of a small building on the outside of Imp's. Quickly taking it down, he assumed nobody had seen it. This was not the case, however, as a player named jared2013 clicked the image before it was taken down. He saved the image to desktop and forgot about it for nearly a year, as he was friends with iTristan.[[File:16.png|thumb|220x220px]] Autumn came and went on 2b2t, as the server plunged into the dead of Winter. The players jared2013 and iTristan had a disagreement, and decided to go their separate ways. Whilst searching through some old pictures on his desktop, jared2013 found the photo of Imperator's Base. Certain it was not photoshopped, he set out with several others to the base in the hopes of destroying it once and for all. On arrival at the X-coordinate, he discovered that there was no path. This did not end the journey, however, as he forged pickaxes and dug 125,000 blocks in the nether to reach his destination. As he approached the correct coordinates, his hopes were nearly shattered as he found only netherrack. About to turn back, an iron tower came into his render just 100 blocks North. He dug to it. More iron towers came into render, more and more until he realized that he had found the ungriefable City of Imps. [[File:17.jpg|thumb|220x220px]][[File:14.jpg|thumb|220x220px]]Tpping through the Nether Portal, he was greeted by the infamous Jesus Statue. A figure popped into render, CainesLaw. Alarmed to see Jared, he promptly gave him a friendly &quot;Hello&quot; and contacted his friends at Imps immediately. To jared's dismay, his arrival at Imps had not been as secret as he wanted, and his Skype blew up with people pleading with him to not grief the legendary base. After walking around for a few hours and viewing the magnificent structures that Imperator's had to offer, he decided. The first block of TNT was laid at the foot of the Jesus statue around 9:00PM EST, December 24, 2015. Thus began a grief that would be known as &quot;The Largest Grief in 2b2t History.&quot; He renamed his account, mailyou, to HiveTyrantRaphi, mocking one of the past players that based at Imp's. Inviting many to help him grief this beast of a base, only one of the people he invited would stay loyal when presented with the vast wealth of Imp's. jared2013 and VlI would grief the base for nearly 48 hours before they ran out of TNT, using over a combined 100,000 TNT blocks in the process. No building was spared from jared2013's wrath, and he made sure to dismantle iTristan's build entirely. During the entire grief, only one fight ever occurred, and it was between jared2013 and CainesLaw. Jared2013 won by using TNT on a staircase, preventing CainesLaw from reaching him. After several hours of griefing, more builds were still be discovered, it seemed almost endless.They concluded the grief by blowing off the head of the Jesus Statue, and thus the Ungriefable Base had been griefed. Christmas Day, 2015, marked the end of a 4-year saga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;Even though Imp's Base is no more, it has a legacy that will never be forgotten, becoming both the biggest base and the biggest grief 2b2t has ever seen, and will likely ever see. Despite the majority of the base's players quitting around 2014, it survived for another year before being destroyed. Imperator's Base shows us that through great teamwork and friendships, massive bases can be constructed, and that with time, these bases will eventually become ruins in the great cycle of 2b2t.&lt;/p&gt;

Might not be the biggest group, but certainly the one with most impressive art work of 2b2t history. The [[Imp Base]] group was composed partly of Imperator’s friends and [[TheJudgeHolden|THEJudgeHolden]]’s friends. With time, other people joined the group (also thanks to several [[Duplication Glitches|dupe glitches]] that allowed them to have great resources to build). Their base commonly known as “Imps” is still one of the largest and most beautiful bases of 2b2t, and for several years was the largest ever. It was griefed on 25th December of 2015 by [[jared2013]], but the group already only had few people still playing. Members are still active, however it is unknown if the actual group still lives on or was disbanded during the course of [[the Rusher War]].

* Member - Basic member, not fully trusted but has shown worth
* Recruit - New applicants who have been accepted into Infrared 

== Phase I (Inferno): October 20th 2017 - January 1st 2018 ==
Infrared (previously known as Inferno) was founded in late October 2017 with the help of the founder's good friend Retronautx. Retronautx invited a handful of friends to join the team, including Metrez and IHackedWalmart. The founder recruited members JoSaZa and Klimax at spawn to help Inferno grow. Once Inferno had about 5-10 members, they erected a headquarters approximately 500k blocks out in the overworld. The headquarters lasted a few weeks until a conflict begun between [[VoCo]] (the Vortex Coalition) and the [[Emperium]] (known as the Vo-Perium war).

=== Vo-Perium war inolvement ===
A member from the Emperium, Racewizard was insiding Inferno and obtained a high rank within the group compromising their HQ. In retaliation to this Inferno made an alliance with VoCo to help fight Emperium, the Vo-Perium war only lasted three weeks with little actually being done. Emperium did manage to send many insiders into Inferno using the same tactics as they used on Visionary, several Inferno bases got griefed, most notably their HQ and Paragon (a base that Inferno claimed). After the Vo-Perium war ended, VoCo and Emperium put their differences aside and made an alliance but Emperium remained hostile to Inferno, causing them to end their alliance with VoCo.

=== End of Phase I ===
Around this time, Retronautx and the founder were arguing on the future direction of the group. Due to frustration, the founder left Inferno and placed Retronautx in charge. Due to insiding, griefing and lack of player activity, Retronautx called for reforms which led to the birth of Infrared.

== Phase II (Infrared): January 2nd 2018 - Present ==
Infrared was a fresh start after the fall of Inferno, a new discord was set up and the old members from Inferno joined as well as many other players, they grew quite rapidly in the first two months of 2018 and accepting many Peacekeepers. The Peacekeepers had gone quite inactive sometime when the Unification period began, IHackedWalmart invited the remaining active Peacekeepers to join the new group (including Pandasauce, the leader of PK). Infrared also sought vengeance on Emperium for completely destroying Inferno and making them have to start over again.

=== United Group Embassy vs. the Alpha Alliance ===
Around the time Infrared was formed, the Emperium had started the United Group Embassy (UGE for short) with over 15 groups joining with the goal of having fun, building and seeking a better future for 2b2t. Infrared was invited by Emperium to join the UGE putting their differences apart, Retronaut acquired the coordinates to their first group base, the 1st Physical Embassy. Retronaut wanted to grief the base and IHackedWalmart carried out the grief giving Infrared lots of negative attention. After some time passed the 3rd Physical Embassy was leaked by Lotus and Fluff of Highland, Infrared and Highland then became allies due to a common enemy. For about a month or two Infrared and Highland would work together in attacking UGE bases and killing members at spawn. Sometime in late Febuary the Peacekeepers would also ally with the two groups due to Infrared's very strong ties to PK, this made a triple alliance and a discord was made for the three groups to interact together, this was named the Alpha Alliance (AA), their goal was to take down the UGE. 

Later on a newly formed small group named Virus would join AA as well as Team Rainbow. AA never built any bases on the main map together and would only let the trusted members from all three groups join, AA was primarily a griefing and pvp group. Battles between UGE and AA were fought many times at spawn, however most of this was done in the Infrared discord rather than AA discord. UGE became very inactive sometime late March 2018 when the tempmap started, on these tempmaps the AA thrived and built several shelters and bases together to survive attacks from enemies. On the third of the the three tempmaps the 6th Incursion began after AntVenom made his video on 2b2t, the 6th incursion had many groups in it that were enemies with AA, a new threat for the alliance had began. 

=== 6th Incursion / Fall of AA / Cold war ===
When the main map went back up after quite some time both AA and the incursion had all their gear and stashes to fight eachother with, AA never posed much of a real threat to the incursion and after the first week or so of the Incursion the AA fell apart due to  too much in fighting between the leaders. Things also began to fall apart for Infrared and Highland and their strong alliance was lost. When the Incursion began to build a wall 2kx2k, small sabotage attempts to take down the wall began, most notably when IHackedWalmart, IHackdWindowsXP and Armorsmith withered the northern wall starting a huge battle, Infrared were outnumbered 20 to 1 and had to retreat. Not much happened after that between Infrared and the Incursion after that. 

After the incursion fights between Infrared and Emperium were fading rapidly but they still kept arguing with one another. Infrared griefed a Spawn Mason base starting unfriendly relations between each other. Tensions with VoCo (their former ally) began after the SIG (Spawn Infrastructure Group) started building at 0,0 nether, IHackedWalmart later withered this platform starting some bitterness but nothing too big. Infrared managed to get over 60 members and began working on bases and kept camping at spawn. The main Freelancer base was discovered and griefed by Infrared, everyone defending the HQ was either killed or had to log, Infrared became the first real enemy of the Freelancers and they declared war, however nothing was done and anything is yet to be done.

=== Vo-Perium vs Infrared ===
Retronaut got the coords to a VoCo base and griefed it, at the base was Coltsnid (leader of VoCo) who Retronaut attacked and made log. After that Coltsnid spoke to two of Emperium's leaders about fighting Infrared with them and making them rebrand like before by flooding them with insiders, starting a new war, The Vo-Perium vs Infrared war. Not so long after the war began 3 Infrared members griefed a VoCo &quot;base&quot; (it was just a tower, a vortex and some wheat farms, no stashes or anything). Infrared has gone into a temporary lockdown so they can find a way to keep the insiders from getting any important bases etc. Infrared has also been working on positive relations with Highland again and members joined Infrared's ranks again. The agreement is that Highland shall remain an independent organisation but their members are allowed to help with the cause if they want to.

== Small Notable Events ==
This is for all the small events that have not received a mention in Phase I or Phase II.

==== Alliance and cold war with the Astral Order  ====
A group named Eden (now Astral) asked Inferno if they would like to make an alliance, Inferno agreed to this however the alliance was cut short because Astral suspected Inferno was insiding them. A cold war broke out between the groups and was resolved approximately a week later. 

==== Metrez drama  ====
Not so long after Inferno reformed into Infrared, a high ranking Infrared member, Metrez had an arguement with Retronaut. After this Metrez betrayed Infrared and warned UGE of plans to attack them, he joined Emperium and stayed with them for a month before being sent to create team Virus to inside the Alpha Alliance. Metrez started off insiding AA but then decided to become an actual member and not inside. After quite some time Metrez was accepted back into Infrared as a friend of Retronaut's again.

==== Lex and Frrost fake betrayal of Infrared  ====
Around the same time all the drama involving Metez happened, Lex and Frrost who were two of the highest ranking Infrared members were sent to inside Emperium by Retronaut. They raided the public discord to show Emperium that they had truly betrayed, they insided Emperium for a few months and got coordinates for the Emperium's Gamma base, the two insiders had already had enough of Emperium and decided to come back to Infrared after the base was destroyed. Unfortunately, the Emperium knew about the raid and withered the base before Infrared could arrive, however Lex had already been welcomed back into Infrared and remained loyal to her long time friend Retronaut. Frrost later quit 2b2t.

==== Disbandment of the Asylum  ====
After City (leader of the Asylum) came back from being sick, him and Retronaut began to become friends. City was also arguing and falling out with Emperium members at this time as well (due to having a ridiculously high ego). Emperium believed that City and Retronaut &quot;dated&quot; leading them to distrust him and Asylum was disbanded.

==== Infrared + Armorstate disaster  ====
Armorsmith held a presidential election for his &quot;country&quot;, Armorstate, Retronaut ran for president and won the election, they set up a discord for a selection of Infrared members and Armorsmith to work on a base together. However, this did not go as planned and coordinates were leaked before construction would start, not long later Infrared betrayed Armorsmith because of how demanding annoying and demanding he was.

==== Second Infrared Discord crisis / Introduction of new Ranking System  ====
Retronaut's discord account got disabled for violating a Discord policy, his account had all owner permissions and that account was the only one that could give out the Deity rank and much more issues like that. Retronaut decided to make a new infrared discord and it was seen as an opportunity to make it better than the last discord. A new ranking system was made, so instead of it being Heat/Ember/Flame/Inferno/Fluorescent/Ultra Violet/Deity it was Recruit/Member/Trusted/Elite/Council/Second in Command/Leader.

== Relations ==
* [[Team Rainbow|Rainbow]] - Strong Allies due to a friendship between Retronaut and Brayin (leader of rainbow).
* [[Highland]] - The two groups were once allies due to a common enemy, however Highland betrayed Infrared and the two groups are &quot;&quot;&quot;somewhat neutral&quot;&quot;&quot;. As of recent Highland members have been accepted into Infrared's ranks again and they now have positive relations once again, however not allies because Highland isn't a faction.
* [[Eyes of the Zodiac|The Eyes of the Zodiac]] - Allies
* [[Emperium]] - Infrared sided with VoCo during the Vo-perium war, since then Infrared and Emperium have not gotten along and when Infrared griefed the United Group Embassy, the two groups have been fighting, insiding and griefing each other ever since.   
* Astral Order - Previously allied, now neutral.
* [[United Group Embassy|All UGE groups]] - Infrared griefed the UGE hq making enemies with them and all the groups in the embassy.
* [[VoCo]] - VoCo and Infrared were once allied during the Vo-perium war. The two groups are no longer allies now due to VoCo allying with Emperium after the war. They are now neutral. After Retronaut griefed a VoCo base, they officially became enemies and the Vo-Perium vs Infrared war began when it was found Coltsnid was talking to Emperium leaders about fighting Infrared.
* [[Soviets]] - Enemies due to their somewhat alliance with Emperium.
* [[Unidad]] - Infrared and Unidad were once allies, they are now no longer after Infrared griefed the Embassy.
* [[Peacekeepers|PK]] - PK is very inactive but many active 2b2t players who are in PK joined infrared and two co leaders of the group (IHackedWalmart and IHackdWindowsXP) are in PK. The two groups played together on the 2b2t tempmaps during the Alpha Alliance, they are strong allies.
* Asylum - Infrared and Asylum were enemies due to many of it's members being in Emperium and also because of City (the leader of asylum) would constantly shittalk and annoy infrared members. Retronaut and City later became friends and have since become more friendly (Asylum is also dead now).
* Eternity - Eternity was insided by infrared with great ease (due to Ultimate21Alex's stupididy) and griefed their spawn base.
* Freelancers - Retronaut and a few infrared members griefed the Freelancer hq making Infrared the first official enemy of the freelancers. The Freelancers declared war on Infrared but infrared don't care.
* Don Fuer - Due to IHackdWindowsXP's hatred for D_loaded and several other Donfuerians and the bitterness between PK and Donfuer, the two groups are enemies.
* Spawn Masons - Relations between these two groups have been relatively neutral, when Inferno were allies with VoCo and the Masons being a group spawned after the &quot;disbandment&quot; of the Vortex Coalition technically that would make the two allies. Recently Infrared griefed a Spawn Mason base making the two unfriendly.

Jaang is an oldfag on 2b2t best known for building the [[Valley of Wheat]]. He has played in two phases from 2011-2012 and late 2013-2014.

== History ==
Jaang first joined 2b2t in 2011. He was a player who kept to himself, neither basing with anyone nor talking in chat. He worked on the Valley of Wheat, becoming the sole builder of it and spending his entire time building and expanding the Valley, never leaving it. Jaang allowed other players to take wheat from the sanctuary but wouldn't allow them to build anything in it. At some point while in the Nether, Jaang was attacked by another player but was saved by [[Offtopia]], who was one of the only players that Jaang interacted with. Offtopia would bring him gifts such as carrots and other new crops that were released. He would also protect the Valley, killing anyone if they did not replant.

In 2018 a player by the name &quot;OreOFied&quot; claimed to be Jaang, saying he got locked out of his original account and had been playing on that one ever since. He says he will try to partially rebuild the Valley Of Wheat and he plans to form a new team based on the old Facepunch Republic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="871">James Rustles was a 2b2t midfag and blogger.

== History ==
In 2013, James Rustles started a blog about 2b2t. It later grew to hold alot of information about 2b2t's history using both primary and secondary sources. The blog also had posts written by other players (like [[Sato86]]) to talk about history or current events on the server.

James Rustles himself has been to many places on the server. His signs can usually be found all over the server. He has also based at many places, Including Asgard II and [[Aureus City]] to name a few.

James quit 2b2t in early June due to him losing interest in the server (this decision wasn't helped by [[TheCampingRusher]]). He left the blog online and is accepting any guests posts at http://www.jamesrustles.com/ [[SmackAttack86]] somewhat took over his job in terms of recording bases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6746">{{NoInfo}}[[File:Mflrkfn.png|thumb|257x257px]]jared_2013, or simply Jared2013, is a well known midfag on the server. He is pretty infamous on the server as he is a notorious griefer, an [[Spawn Incursions|Incursion]] starter, and was known for being an actual enemy of [[Valkyria]] in [[the Third Incursion]] . He is also pretty known to be a loose-cannon, as he is known to make outrages (sometimes being autistic) and no one never really expects what he will do next. However, he is also known to be a very good historian on the server and has written interesting articles on both the 2b2t subreddit and several other places.

He has actually offered to help this wiki on October 30th, 2016 but since no one was contributing at that point, he didn't stay. In early August of 2017, Jared2013 returned to the wiki as an admin promoted by Niftyrobo. He deleted 240+ pages (the entire Wiki) for biased reasons (mostly dealing with the history of newfags and newfag bases). After that, as well as banning a lot of people and changing then look of the site to a red one with the [[Spawn Masons|Spawn Mason]] symbol as the logo, he raged on the 2b2t subreddit about &quot;griffing the wiki&quot;. He was banned along with Niftyrobo roughly one day later by global wikia staff.

While he is good at calling everyone newfaggots and [[autistism|autistic]] (even some old players), this backfires on him when he gets upset, and rages in chat.

== History ==
This has been taken from the 2b2t subreddit, posted by Jared himself.

August 2013:

I had bought my account D4RKJ0E nearly two years before. The faction server I had been playing for several months went down after the 4chan posts stopped. I remember vaguely during the last days of the server I had received a gift from an old friend on the server. They gave me an account and told me where they were going next. A place called 2b2t.org, though when I had first joined it was 2b2t.net. I had been there before on my account D4RKJ0E, and checked it out a few times before on some friends accounts. The idea of a new account, however, was thrilling. I previously had not conceived of needing another account to play minecraft.

November 2013:

I had been playing 2b2t again for a few months now on my account D4RKJ0E when I decided to check my screenshot folder for some coordinates. Though I did not find the coordinates I was looking for, I found something far more valuable. I found the account that Dr_Cash had given me months ago. 1.7 had just hit 2b2t and I was eager to explore for new biomes, but D4RKJ0E was already settled in an ocean castle I found nearly 200,000 blocks from Spawn. I decided to log into the account.

jared2013 has joined the game.

was the first message that appeared in my chat when I logged into that account. Though within seconds I would see another,

jared2013 was slain by thePOMPANO using 420 NAMASTE 420.

It was during the Second Incursion.

Spawn was not the gray lavacast-filled space that it is today, rather, it was black. Black with the dragon eggs that engulfed the area. I respawned in a little house overlooking a massive hole. From y = 80 I could see straight down to bedrock and not a single stone block in my entire view. A wither popped into view,

&quot;[[Pyrobyte|PYROBYTE]] IS KING OF 2B2T, VIVAT REX!&quot;

as well as a player. I could barely make out the name, but I recognised it from the name of the Wither. It was Pyrobyte. Other players popped into my view, players such as [[popbob]] , [[x0XP]] , [[iTristan]] , [[fubster]] , and [[xcc2]] . There was a battle going on. I hid myself among the rocks so I wouldn't be enveloped in the chaos. I stood vigilantly nearby the rocks, though continuously I watched the battle unfold. Eventually, there was a logger. Someone else had died on the bedrock below, and I took the chance to sneak in and grab their items. Luckily, the diamond guards were not interested in me and only sought to defeat the logger. I left with a full set of god armour, god apples, and some tools. I made it as far as seven-hundred blocks away from Spawn before I was caught by Coldwave.

Some time later that week in November:

I had been playing 2b2t again for a few days now on my new account jared2013. Chat was flooded with nonsensical bullshit and links to porn, the good old days. I heard rumours about a base that held the wealth of the Incursion members. A base called &quot;[[Valkyria]].&quot; On my way out of Spawn, I traveled down the X+ highway for a few thousand before meeting someone. [[Pyrobyte]] again. I asked him if I could help with the Incursion, and he said no. But, he said, he would give me armour and tools. I gladly accepted his offer and equipped myself with a full set of Pyro's Paramount and Anathema. Then we parted. I continued onward along the unforgiving X+ highway, and he headed out back towards Spawn to resume the massacre. Around 5k Nether I stumbled upon a sign in the road. It read, &quot;Valkyria x=&lt;em&gt;redacted&lt;/em&gt;, z - &lt;em&gt;redacted&lt;/em&gt;&quot; I smirked at the sign and thought it simply another shitpost. When I reached the junction in which I could decide whether or not to check out the supposed coordinates, my thoughts were interrupted by an unusual comment in chat. &quot;Valkyria has just been griefed by drewbookman&quot; [[Sato86]] said. Comments flooded the chat with talk regarding Valkyria's destruction. In the commotion someone leaked the coordinates, the exact coordinates I had seen previously on the sign.

December 7, 2013:

The destruction of Valkyria and [[NFE]] ( Which I will write about on some other occasion ) brought about the end of an era on 2b2t. Many of those regulars during the Second Incursion have not been seen to this day. The end of the Second Incursion marked the beginning of a period in which no duplication glitches were present which lasted until mid 2016.

The end of 2013 yielded the end of the golden age, and paved the way for the shitstorm 2b2t is today.

Doesn’t do shit nowadays. If only some anon would trigger him to get his shit together and spawn the next incursion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1163">===== For the Jesus statue, see [[Imperator's Base]] =====
Jesus Christ is a meme on 2b2t. He is often shown in videos saying &quot;divine&quot; things. The first Jesus video was uploaded in July 2, 2016, titled Rusher.m4v. A second Jesus video entitled Jesus visits 2b2t was uploaded in February 17, 2017. It should be noted that the two Jesus videos are completely different, however still fall under the same meme.

== Rusher.m4v Transcript ==
Chorus: Jesus!!!!! [Jesus rises up]

Jesus: [[TheCampingRusher|Rusher]], you retarded faggot. Get off the 2b2t. You and your bitch army of six-year-olds ruined the entire fucking place. Get the hell out of here, and drink some bleach while you are at it. Long live the vets. Word of God.

Chorus: Jesus!!!! [Jesus goes down]

== Jesus visits 2b2t ==
&quot;Hello players of 2b2t. Jesus here. I don't know if you've noticed, but there's been a lot of lightning recently. That's because of our lord and savior, [[Caviyaz]]. So remember, every time lightning strikes, a vatarian dies. And praise to [[Bible Bot|BibleBot]], for making 2b2t a family-friendly Christian Factions server. Jesus out.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3569">'''Kaiser Cross Highway''' is a road that runs along the axis of quadrants, as denoted by a sign in the center of this road before -2k-2k. Confirmed part starts at a water cube around -1500, -1500 and stretches in the direction to [[Imperator's Base]] (ruins of which are scattered around -1M) and is excepted to reach the World Corner in it's Nether version. At least if players don't take the [[Swastikas|Swastika]] center-to-border-to-corner approach.

Due to it's diagonal nature, it can't be [[Travel|traveled]] along with slimeblock and piston [[Airships|airship]] and while the traveled euclidean distance is the same, less blocks will be explored, only 2^(1/2)/2 times the amount when going in a cardinal direction.

==Intersections==

It runs 6 blocks under the old 400 block road network (+/- 400, 800, 1200, 1600, 2000), mostly apparent at -2k-2k, where it's kind of interrupted from all the Withers down there.

The highway crosses the [[Melon Highway]] at -2629, providing a good [[Spawn]] escaping route for McLeaks alts and the smarter of newfags who didn't sleep during their math class and who might be studying for an engineering degree so they have no friends, which is good for [[2b2t|this server]] where you shall trust no-one. Note that the Melon Highway is currently griefed until around -5k for this exact reason.

==Profile==

The central part of this [[Highway]] consists of diagonally outlined center part, usually in different blocks than those around them. This highway is not necesarily made from obsidian so all fags are safer from being [[Suicide Bombing (Crystal/Bed Bombing)|crystalled]] than on the 4 axis highways. The altitude of the Kaiser Cross Highway is the one of the old ocean floor, or y=64. It has to cut through all the terrain, creating many tunnels. Those are usually 5 high in the center, suggesting they were made by explosives, such as TNT or crystals. This altitude allows for motorway-like intersections with the remnants of old 400 block road grid, which runs at y=70.

The width of the Kaiser Cross higway is around 5 block on each axis, which due to its diagonal direction, leads to the walk-through profile being only the euclidean distance of 5, and from the Pythagorean theorem we get:

5=(2w^2)^(1/2)

which we simplify to:

5=2w

which yields the result that:

w=5/2

or 2 1/2 or 2.5 on each side from the center piece, so the entire highway is realized by alternating 2 and 3 blocks diagonally.

==Landmarks==

Coords from 2b2t.online ([http://www.2b2t.online]), rounded heavily. With the current state of the supersonic elytra flying [[exploits]] the errors are negligible.

The base was also the first base built by HappySeniorMan in september 2016. You can find the world download on the museum server today.

[[File:2016-10-11 16.21.24.png|thumb|217x217px]]

== Purpose ==
Kektown was used as the main hideout for [[HappySeniorMan]], who used it originally as a temporary base, until he realised nobody could find it, then he invested more time and resources into the base. It was lucky positioning for Happy, who used the positioning to get to spawn quickly. Eventually GalaxyDoughnut moved in and built her own house upon a hill, overlooking the base.

== Griefing ==
Eventually, after many expansions and updates, Happy wanted to have a youtuber tour the base. He messaged [[Doctrzombie]], a youtuber, about the base, and in doing so leaked the coordinates to the base. It took a long 3 weeks until someone found and griefed the base, and in that time the two were able to escort valuables and make a world download of the base. It was griefed late january 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2018">King's Landing, also known as the IDMM, was one of the most, if not the most, massive bases of 2b2t. It was founded by [[Oremonger]], drewbookman, and [[Branillon]] sometime in June of 2015.{{Space_Valkyria|title1 = King's Landing|coordinates = X: 684,314 Y: 64 Z: -341,914|builder = |dimension = |destroyed = September 22nd, 2015|built = Sometime in June, 2015|griefer = |builder(s) = Oremonger, Caleesii, SilverKrownKing, Yellowstonejoe, Drewbookman, zxcwbz, Rustle_League, iTristan, TheBalonyPony, Daramada, Branillon, 8 others|griefer(s) = Oremonger, SilverKrownKing, iTristan and pals, other random people}}
== History ==
After the events of [[Spawn Incursions|the third incursion]] , Oremonger and Branillon decided to head far away from spawn and build King's Landing. The name of the base was voted on by the invited members, with Branillon coming up with the winning name (The name was potentially a reference to Game of Thrones). The base constructed was enormous with several projects being done.

The peace, as with most bases on 2b2t, did not last with the members and [[iTristan]] leaked the base in the public chat during [[Backdoors|the third backdoor]]. Oremonger and [[SilverKrownKing]] ended up having to destroy the base as they knew it was only a matter of time before someone else destroyed it. iTristan and his buddies from [[the Tyranny]] eventually dumstered the place more.

== Architecture ==
The base had multiple personal builds of the 20 members. Builds included futuristic houses, AwesomeGuyMonkey's treehouse, pixel art, Caleesii's giant castle, a large dragon, a hand with a levitating ball, several automated farms and Oremonger's auto 265 item sorter, the first one ever seen on 2b. This sorter operated using a glitch in Minecraft that is named &quot;glass elevator&quot; in which items are pushed through glass blocks and flow into hoppers and chests.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1241">The Kingsman, Founded by Breadl, is a group with 2 different divisions within it, noth should, in some way or another fit every Players play-style. There is a set director to run each division. The following will explain a little bit of information about each division and what they do.

[[Spawn]] Division- The Spawn division did not have a solid core purpose, as one meaningful enough to stand was not been put in place. But what they did at spawn is make spawn-bases fill them with builds, loot, and members of course, then they would purge dupe stashes all around the spawn area and bring the material's back to one of our spawn bases. With that we go to spawn, they were mostly neutral until provoked and hang-out and work on small side-projects.

Base Division- The base division is more simply put, the builder group, when someone wants to join this straight away they will have to fit the criteria and be a above average builder. The bases are abstract for now but in the future will most likely have a solid theme.




This Group is Inactive-and or Disabled

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1152">The '''Kinorana Map Crisis '''was a week-long crisis in 2b2t when [[Kinorana]] , a trader in 2b2t, changed all the maps in 2b2t thanks to an exploit. This was originally a prank, until spiraling down into chaos.

== Background ==
On February 25th, 2017, all maps were changed by Kinorana. This caused madness across the server and the players. People bashed on kino in the [[subreddit]] .

However, prior to the prank, he contacted [[Hausemaster]] to warn him and save all map files so he can restore the maps if he wanted to.

== Drama ==
On February 28th, 2017, grindlord and other [[deathspammers]] in 2b2t began to flood the chat with things such as &quot;KINO IS A FAGGOT&quot;, &quot;send KINO to ISIS&quot;, &quot;PEICE OF A SHIT HAUSE FIX MAPS&quot;. Even [[BibleBot]] joined the protest. The subreddit was full of threads about the map issue.

== Aftermath ==
The drama ended on March 3rd. However, Kinorana's map still remains as a ghost map. The maps can still be restored if the original [[map art]] build has been visited. This also leaves new map art to be created.

&lt;includeonly&gt;Huthifa is gay&lt;/includeonly&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2563">The Kool Kids Klub is a base founded by [[c1yd3i]] and [[Rustle_League]] . It was started as the two got bored from travelling as far as they could away from spawn. The base was famous for housing the largest gold farm in 2b2t history, outsizing even the one at [[Aureus]] .
[[File:Screenshot 2016-12-04 at 9.50.57 AM.png|thumb|220x220px|Largest gold farm in 2b2t history]]

== History ==
[[C1yd3i]] and [[Rustle_League]] , when they first joined, wanted to get as far away from spawn as they could. Eventually they reached the millions by travelling on the Nether highway. At some point though, they got tired and have founded the base sometime in 2014. The two began working on the base and eventually began to slowly invite other players such as [[James_Rustles]] , who arrived November 25th, 2014, [[SilverKrownKing]] , [[DocSmurf]] , and [[Dr.Cash]] . James_Rustles eventually invited [[Fit]] to join the base. According to Fit, when he arrived, the base was really ugly. The group had large ambitions for the base and they eventually agreed to build the largest gold farm in 2b2t history.

During construction, the group decided to create a large pyramid around the farm. On December 20th, 2014, the base was completed and the portals for the farm were lit, which actually lagged the server. The farm was able to produce a stack of god apples in under 20 minutes, according to Fit, which was an insane feat on the server. 75% of all the manufactured god apples in the server's economy came from the Kool Kids Klub during late 2014 and early 2015. The base had one major weakness however, and that was that it was very close to the highway. This issue inevitably caused the base to meet its fate when someone stubbled upon the base by accident. The coords were then leaked to the public and the base was destroyed. This lead to the group taking as many god apples as they could and splitting to grander ventures, which was eventually [[Valkyria]] .

== Trivia ==
* The abbreviation of the Kool Kids Klub is KKK which is a reference to the Ku Klux Klan

== Summary ==

LORD PASTA is a small 2b2t youtuber who gives the latest 2b2t news, as well as occasional &quot;2b2t theory videos&quot;. He started making videos after [[the Rusher War]].

== 2b2t theory ==
[[File:2b2t theory Thumbnail.png|thumb|476x476px]] 
His &quot;2b2t theory&quot; videos offered a look into how 2b2t related to real world anarchist philosophies. For example the idea that 2b2t is mutualist anarchy, and that most factions servers were minarchist in nature. The anarchist idea that most completely describes 2b2t is mutualism because the mutualist states that you can only own something when you use it. This is seen in 2b2t as there are is no such thing as property on 2b2t, the only property you can safely say is yours is what is in your inventory, or, in other words, what you use. This is contrasted with a capitalist notion that you can own things like land, and property even if you do not use them.

== Groups, and YouTube ==
As for groups, he mainly went solo, but he did base with a few people once in a base called &quot;Agriculture II&quot; with CooCooDog123, 0nger, Re_lay, Mineitup, TotalDarkness, and Elykkeer. The base was raided by a player named Crystalinqq. Also known as the leader of Team [http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/Team_Coca_Cola Coca-Cola]. [[File:Screen Shot 2017-07-21 at 2.48.14 AM.png|thumb|357x357px]]Although it was growing, he decided to delete his first channel in june of 2017 to try to give himself a fresh start. You can still find his old videos if you look hard enough on Youtube.

&quot;Alright guys, I really should have made a video before I did this, but everybody would just be telling me not to do it then. I'll explain myself now so you don't have to worry anymore. I had that channel for around 4 years. That being so, most of the old videos were of me when I was a kid, and did not go with the rest of my content. I love 2b2t, and I will still play it, but when I started to do it on my channel that was a bit of a mistake. To be completely honest if it was not for me getting such a large following from 2b2t, I would have just let the channel become dormant a few months ago, or outright deleted it sooner. This is because I really don't want to be a gaming YouTuber anymore. I would have a lot of ideas for videos that I knew I could never make on that channel. Additional reasons include the fact that I feel like I gave out too much information about myself in some videos, and I would kind of like to be a bit more anonymous. Also, I don't want the stress of always worrying about what will get me more subs, and what might make people mad. I really just want to be able to make whatever. I know that I could have done that, but in the long run it would have never worked for the audience that I had because, while most people would be fine with different content some would not, and the people who I would otherwise gain from my new content would not be pleased with my gaming videos. finally there is the question of if I were to become a professional YouTuber, and do this as my hobby, would I be forced to always play 2b2t, and Minecraft? That could not be the case, but based on what I previously mentioned it may be.&quot;

He said in response to questioning, like a massive pussy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5078">== Synopsis ==
Lag machines are machines created by players with the intention of making the server as laggy as possible by lowering the [[TPS]]. This is often done with the intention of making the server unplayable for new players without god tools and causing them to quit. They are often turned on whenever a youtuber joins or starts streaming in order to make it harder for them to make videos. During the [[The Rusher War|Rusher War]], lag machines were used extensively against [[TheCampingRusher]] by making it very hard for him to make a base. Combined with a lack of content and the inability to build anything due to the lag, TheCampingRusher eventually quit 2b2t.

== History ==
Besides the unintentional lag machine activity caused by Oremonger's redstone contraptions (such as his clock) or gold farms, the first noted use of ''weaponized ''lag machines was done by DemonElite119 at Zootopia and The Land of Wolves in an attempt to punish the swarms of newfags that he viewed to be a plague upon a once relatively quiet server as well as to make it difficult for those without beacons and god tools to build, however it was a double edged sword as it also made it somewhat easier for newfags to escape spawn as the tick rate was so low, hunger drained at a slower rate. At one point, DemonElite119 showed Torogadude one of his lag machine designs. 

Despite DemonElite119's objections, Torogadude leaked the lag machine designs to other players, including fellow oldfags, midfags, and even newfags resulting in both DemonElite119 being enraged to the point he was leaking bases out of sheer contempt as well as the mass proliferation of lag machines to players who otherwise had no idea how to construct them which resulted in long term low TPS as there was no longer any control on who was operating them due to the widespread deployment of them by various groups who used them just for the lulz. Torogadude leaked these designs both in various chats such as a Skype chat with users such as Parthicus and Jacktherippa, but also on Youtube which was the source of the mass proliferation. 

As time dragged on, and Housemaster attempted to implement soft-countermeasures against lagmachines, Sun_Wukon would join DemonElite119 in the controlled use of lag machines, however this all went out the window after DemonElite119 leaked the base and lag machines were widely proliferated thanks to Torogadude's reckless attempts at attention seeking by means of a Youtube video that detailed the lag machine constructs as well as Oremonger's clock.

== 2017 Crisis ==
2017 saw one of the worst years for TPS on 2b2t. A player by the name of househousehouse1 built a large lag machine in the begining of the year, probably the largest ever built on 2b2t. He would use this lag machine pretty often, and constantly cause the server to crash. At around the same time, another player by the name of Armorsmith built his own powerful lag machine, which also caused the server to crash and drop TPS below 1. The method used by househousehouse1 was different from the one used by Armorsmith, while househousehouse1 method involved redstone wires and powering them to extreme levels, Armorsmith's design was based on one posted by 2F4U on YouTube a while back.

These two lag machines forced Hausemaster to take action, and he did so by breaking redstone on 2b2t. He also started to delete lag machines using world edit, making some people think that 2b2t isn't a true anarchy server. One of the most famous laggers on 2b2t is Gr1f. When Hausemaster deleted his lag machine, he also deleted the priority queue Gr1f had before because he joined before June 1st 2016. This would cause a major drama later on.

Armorsmith also begun naming his lag machines. Carolina was probably the first named lag machine on 2b2t. househousehouse1 would name his lag machine by the name jejmachine. The Carolina series, infact, became a well-known one and a lot of lag machines named Carolina were built by different players, such as OfficialSpeed, DaPorkchop_, P529 and househousehouse1. The last few Carolina lag machines used a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pfH902GzrA method] by Gr1f which was recently patched when Hausemaster broke armor stands.

== Countermeasures ==
There are few countermeasures for lag machines, short of Housemaster deleting them. 

The only solid and reliable countermeasure is the deployment of beacons and god tools in order to &quot;defeat&quot; the low tickrate the server suffers as a result of the lag machines. Housemaster has tried other measures short of deleting them to offset their impact, but it was minimal, when one of DemonElite119's lag machines could bring the server down to 1tps, it only improved the server by 5 tps at most, with the server maxing out at 10, but often still dropping to 3-5tps, especially as DemonElite119 built more lag machines and Sun_Wukon also followed DemonElite119's lead by creating a series of networked lag machines built upon DemonElite119's own design.

The Largest Battles On 2b2t were large armed encounters that have occurred on 2b2t that proved to have the largest amount of combatants seen in the history of 2b2t. Currently, 4 battles have been recorded to be the biggest, however, there may have been more undocumented battles that occurred over 2b's long history and recording only began during and after the events of [[the Rusher War]].

== Known Largest Battles ==
Note: If there have been larger battles or battles that had less combatants than the ones listed, please feel free to add and rearrange the order accordingly. Keep in mind that battle on 2b2t today usually is very limited on deaths, therefore casualties will include fleeing, combat logging, and actual deaths, in there small amounts.
# Battle of Spawn - The largest battle ever seen on 2b2t and the largest battle during [[the Rusher War]]. The battle was recorded to have +30 combatants of varying groups such as the Peacekeepers, Team Aurora, the 4th Reich, Team Rusher, and Team Veteran. Its been noted that 30 Veterans (including 4th Reich members) and 3 Rushers were present at the battle.

'''Lavacasts''' are player-created structures often used for griefing. 
==Structure==
Lavacasts mostly consist of cobblestone. They might also contain obsidian (mostly in the center of the cast) and stone (usually on the base, due to bodies of water getting in contact with lava). Of course, anything that has been covered by a lavacast or was left in it can also be there if it wasn't destroyed. They usually resemble mountains or pyramids, and sometimes also spires or other shapes, depending on the terrain and the way the lavacast was casted. Lavacasts often contain small air pockets.
==Making and destroying lavacasts==
While there are multiple techniques of creating lavacasts, they all generally revolve around pointing water on lava from above. When it comes to destruction, the only two reasonable ways are fast pickaxes (like ones used for highways) and TNT. Even with those, however, making lavacasts is faster than destroying them.
==Usage==
Lavacasts are usually used to grief bases or the spawn. They might also be used to easily create walls, pyramids or artificial mountains. A rare but well-known usage of lavacasts is creating huge symbols, the most famous example od this is the [[giant cobblestone swastika]] . Lavacasts are never intentionally placed in serious, aesthetical bases, but are common as a cheap way to do things.

Using lavacasts to grief a build is called &quot;lavacasting&quot; (for example: &quot;I have just lavacasted The Valley of Wheat for the 326th time!!&quot;).

'''[[Timeline|Timeline of 2b2t]]'''

&lt;--- [[First Valkyrian Period]]

---&gt; [[Second Valkyrian Period]]

The Legion Gape Interlude is a section of history on 2b2t. This Era started when Valk members went to do solo projects and joined other small groups after the destruction of Asgard. Meanwhile, the [[The Legion of Shenandoah]] was gaining more power.

== Notable Events ==
* After the Asgard failure, most Valk members went into solo goals or joined minor groups and initiatives, such as Gape 1, Gape 2 and Judge's Oldcity project. 
* The Legion of Shenandoah became stronger in numbers and more known at this period as well.  
* 2k2k, one of the oldest bases of 2b2t was then destroyed following the destruction of NFE months before. 
* A griefer, known as Dyceley, griefed many famous bases. He helped wither down NFE, 2k2k, and utterly destroyed Plugin Town.

Lifeisgood72 was a player that joined in May 2016 as a result of the Vice article. It all started when he was viewing /r/minecraft. He found a post that linked to the Vice article about 2b2t. He played on the server for 5 minutes but then left because it was a laggy piece of shit(still is)

After the rusher invasion, he rediscovered the server, however was unable to play due to the queue. When they introduced the oldfag queue, the gates had been unleashed.

Lifeisgood72's first action on the server was heading to the [[Valley of Wheat]] . He mined a shitton of wheat without replanting, then headed for overworld travel. He decided to travel across the diagonals and head to 100k 100k. Along the way, he found [[Beefytown]] , griefed it (shittly, as he had not enough time) and then continued on. When he headed to 100k 100k, he made the World Trade Center recreation.

Lifeisgood72 is now known as one of the most notorious players on the server, griefing every single standing build until his is the last standing. He even surpassed[[ popbob]] on the epic scale. He is now considered one of the top 2b2t legends of all time, and will be remembered by 2b2t historians for decades on end.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="805">The Lonely island was a base created in 2011 by Momo_the_Bear. Momo themed the island around solitude and loneliness due to there not being many people at the island (It's not very clear if Momo was the only person or not). 

== Architecture ==
The most unique thing about the Lonely Island is the giant statue of the Forever Alone meme. The island also has many wooden houses, thought most are just pretend businesses like shops and restaurants. The island also is unique because it has many games like Chess, Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots, redstone Dice, and some others.

== The Island Today ==
Only a couple people know the coordinates. [[Caviyaz]] has been protecting the island for months now, and the Lonely Island is now in [[Project Vault]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1654">{{NoInfo}}[[File:Lowland.jpg|thumb|The symbol used by the Lowland]]The Lowland was a very mysterious group in that they only existed on reddit, but when they left in early 2014, all of the posts were deleted. Now the only evidence left for them is in their symbol.

The Lowland started in 2013, with two players by the name of SpanishMoss and Cook1eCr33p3r. These two players had had encounters with [[pigs]], and they wanted revenge. They started the Lowland just to kill pigs, and the lowland was a group that was made to systematically destroy all pigs within 10k of spawn. Originally, the group was going to expand to 20k, but something stopped them.

Because the group was very unorganized, some signs are found outside of 10k, or even 20k. The signs were used to comminicate that the area had been cleared of pigs to other Lowlanders. (that's why it says that death lives here)

However, if was a futile effort. If a player stayed in a de-pigged area long enough, a pig was sure to spawn, so pigs gradually started to appear within the 10k radius of spawn. After a year of genocide, the group dissapeared without a trace.

Or so we thought.

This symbol is a sign that things live on, even though the Lowlander group is dead and their posts are long gone, their symbol still remains as a memento to the old times of de-piggetry. Even though the group has been lost, and most of the evidence is gone, their legacy remains, and the pig population is just a little bit lower.

Luke2thebun (Also known as Mweorz) was a [[4channers|4channer]] that is infamous for his griefing, he has griefed many well known bases like [[Passie Town|Passie town]] and [[2k2k]]. It is unknown when Luke joined, but it is guessed that he joined in 2011, and it is possible that he still may be on 2b2t. Luke2thebun has also visited some 2b2t clones like 9b9t. Luke even has a youtube channel that seems to be active, link: https://www.youtube.com/user/TheGuby123[[File:6fed6b6d235375bf22baf34ab57666b0cef4ea28e388a868d3e0c77764848489.png|thumb|200x200px]][[Category:Players]]

He came back as of January in 2016 and joined found a base called &quot;The One Man Village&quot; This village was roumored to have been moved from 10k blocks to over 8.5 mil blocks by one man, block by block. He received a sword from an old Valkyria member for his service on 2b2t. The sword had a sharpness 20 Enchant and he hid it at the base... Later as of December 25 of 2016 he called quits... He is asking people to guard the base because he is no longer coming back. He visits 2b2t once every month to say hi and see what has changed on the server. He quit because of everything that has been patched, and everything that has been disabled.

[[File:501px-2b2tmaps.png|thumb|220x220px|Many (if not all) of the most common map art from before the [[kinorana map crisis]].]]
Map art is a form of Minecraft art that can be created by making large scale terraforming and filling in the map with art from a bird's eye view, map art can be increased in resolution by adding scaling the art up across multiple maps as can be seen with much of the higher quality maps. Map art was a form of currency on 2b2t as several people made map art in order to sell copies to people for other valuable goods after all anyone can make perfect diamond armour but few can make good map art. Many people see map art as the most beautiful thing to come out of 2b2t

Some donated maps to [[Fit]]'s first historical museum which were then stolen by [[Oxymoron]] who sold them on. These images included memes, anime, flags, Nazi related images, and several other images.
[[File:Ridealong feb28 6b.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Spartan115's Rainbow Dash My Little Pony Map Art]]
Mojant set a limit of 32768 maps per world for some reason and any maps made after this will have the ID : 0 and be incredibly glitched. This limit was reached during the 11/11 dupe. As of now, thanks to good ol' Hause the limit isn't full and new map art can be created. This will likely change when a new dupe will be discovered.
[[File:7ozkg1jlthl01.png|thumb|220x220px|That's not map art, THIS is map art]]
Examples of map art include Kappa, Rainbow dash, The Swastika, The Swastika (4), The Swastika (6), Adolf Hitler, The Jew Flag (4), The ISIS flag (4), Southern Flag (4), Italian Flag (2), Here's Johnny!, The Union Jack (4), Everything's coming up Milhouse!, that anime one (won't catch me with that weeb shit) The Trollface, The Fireflower and many more.

== Trivia ==
* Watermarked Map Art is a far better way to get famous on 2b2t than to make lag machines.
* You can buy and sell map art on the 2b2t shop (Never click a link on that website though).
* Map Art should be created/tested (if made from an image-&gt;map art schematic converter) in a creative superflat world before using schematica to copy it into 2b2t.
* If you're going to make map art it's preferrable that you don't make it some anime bull.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1283">The Melon Highway, sometimes referred to as the Melon Road, was a mini highway that ran along the negative X axis for roughly 12,500 blocks. The highway was unique in that it is made entirely out of [[Melons|melon]] stalks planted on farmland, with dirt blocks to either side for melons to grow on. It is essentially a highway that players can travel without going hungry (or at least, that was the idea). It started roughly at X: -47 Y: 72 Z: -2,628 and exits of off the [[-Z Axis Highway|Negative Z Highway]].

Originally, it encircled spawn in a square loop about 2000 blocks from 0,0, and was constructed in late 2015 and early 2016 by the Melon Disciples, starting at a spot next to [[2k2k]]. For a long time it served as the easiest way for players at [[spawn]] to obtain food, and saved many from starvation. But immediately after the [[The Rusher War|Rusher Invasion]] began (and [[TheCampingRusher|Rusher]] and Mitch used a part of the melon highway to the east of 0,0 to obtain food) the melon highway was dismantled by [[Team Veteran|Veterans]] in order to cut off the Rushers' food supply. Today, parts of the original melon highway are periodically replanted and removed by players.

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“Few cubes get our mouths watering and stomachs rumbling quite like the melon block. It's a tasty treat that drops slices which keep your food bar looking healthy and a block that can be used to build a deliciously nutritious looking house. But hang on a second... a block that's also a melon? Has the world gone mad?”&lt;/p&gt;
*&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Tom Stone (some guy at mojang apparently)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“Blessed be thy melon. One earth as it is on melon. Forgive us our steak, as we forgive those who give us steak. And lead us not onto golden carrot, and deliver us from baked potato. For thine is thy food and glory forever. Amen.”&lt;/p&gt;
*&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The melon’s prayer&lt;/p&gt;

=='''Melons'''==
Since their addition in beta 1.8, melons, also known as watermelons, mellones, and watermellones, have always been recognised on 2b2t as one of the better crops in the game. Even though they require twice as much space to grow as most other crops, they only need to be planted once, and once a stalk is fully grown, it will continually provide a supply of melon blocks, which drop melon slices. While melon slices are a pretty bad food item individually, a single melon block can drop a lot of slices, and since melon stalks grow melon blocks with great regularity, you can really easily obtain a really large amount of melon slices. And since the stalk doesn’t need to be harvested and you can make melon seeds out of the slices, players building farms near spawn don’t have to worry about other players not replanting because there’s no need to harvest the stalk. Plus, you can build stuff out of melons, which is something you can’t do with most other crops. Of course, pumpkins have most of the same properties as melons, but you can’t eat them without making them into a pie first, so nobody cares about them (except [[Fit]], of course).

For all these reasons, melons are the prime choice of anyone looking to build a farm at [[spawn]], both for new players and for more experienced players that are at spawn and need food. And it’s for that precise reason that so many melon farms in the vicinity of spawn exist. Melon farms around spawn became such a common sight that the whole concept was memed, and eventually a group of players who liked building spawn farms started calling themselves the “melon disciples” and took the meme to a new level by worshipping the melons and building large structures out of them.

The melon disciples, though not a particularly well-known group due to the fact that they never get involved in faction politics, have made a lot of major contributions to the server over the years. The most obvious are the [[Melon Highway|melon highways]] at spawn; both the one that encircles spawn about 2000 blocks away from 0,0, and the one that runs east from about two and a half thousand blocks north of 0,0; which most players are familiar with. These highways are four block wide dirt roads with melon stalks growing on the middle two blocks, with melons growing from those stalks on the adjacent dirt blocks. They and other players and groups have also built a ton of melon farms, some of them really huge, all over the vicinity of spawn, as well as several spawnbases.

The creations of the melon disciples and other melon farm builders have helped new players indiscriminately. It was the melon road that saved [[TheCampingRusher]] and MrMitch361 from starvation in their first video, and the base in which they concluded their first video (and which was no longer there in the beginning of their second) was actually built by the melon disciples. The melon farms they built all over the place were a major enabler of the [[Team Rusher|rushers]] during the first days of the war, before they were mostly destroyed by the [[Team Veteran|veterans]] in order to cut off their food supply. However, the melon disciples never actively helped the rushers, and leaned more towards the side of the veterans during the conflict because of all the destruction the rushers were causing.

The activity of the melon disciples at spawn was at its height in late 2015 and early 2016, around the time they built the first melon highway. They are also known for building several really impressive bases, such as Acacia, [[Wintermelon]], and [[Summermelon]], and for their signature melon banner. Many of their members have either quit or no longer play regularly, but many of them do still get on and build, and many players of varying allegiances still build melon farms around spawn today.
=='''Trivia'''==
*&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;There are four melon items/blocks in the game: melon seeds, melon stalks, melon blocks, and melon slices. The four items are all parts of a sort of life cycle for the melon, as seeds become stalks, stalks become blocks, blocks become slices, and slices become seeds. It’d be like the circle of life, but circles don’t exist, of course&lt;/p&gt;
*&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Buildings made out of melons can be found throughout the outer spawn areas, generally in the vicinity of a melon farm. The most common structure made out of melons you’ll find is a cross, sometimes several crosses together. Also popular are cubes, towers, churches, and creeper statues.&lt;/p&gt;
*&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Melons are one of the only memes on 2b2t that doesn’t have anything to do with cancerous chat spam&lt;/p&gt;
*&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Cube-shaped melons actually exist in real life, for some reason&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19538">{{Autism}}A meme is &quot;an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture&quot;. A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, [[File:BnWmD60.png|thumb|You.]]gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme. In 2b2t it is a comedic idea or symbol that is widespread on the server.

'''THIS PAGE SERVES AS A MEME PAGE TO STORE ALL THE MORE POPULAR 2b2t MEMES, IF YOU KNOW OF ANYMORE PLEZ ADD, DANKE'''
==A Friendly Christian Server==
A Friendly Christian Server is a meme on 2b that states that 2b2t was a family friendly Christian server for ages. Obviously, this is a joke as 2b has always been recognized as the world's worst server for its anarchy where anything flies (ie horrible chat, Nazi references, etc.). It is uncertain if anyone falls for this but if they do, it'd be absolutely hilarious that they would believe this. This meme clearly stems from BibleBot originallly.
[[File:Images-1.jpg|thumb|220x220px]]
[[File:6bb (1).jpg|thumb|220x220px]]

=== Other Variants ===
This meme has several varients that all have the same or similar meanings. These include (but not limited too):
* A Child Friendly Server
* A Family Friendly Server
* A Family Christian Server
==SmackAttack86==
A retard who quit 2b2t due to being &quot;bullied&quot; and getting doxxed. [[SmackAttack86|More]]
==OLDEST SERVER IN MINECRAFT!!!==
{{Rusher}}
{{Autism}}
The saying &quot;Oldest Server in Minecraft&quot; is a meme used by players around the 2b2t community. It comes from [[TheCampingRusher]]'s 2b2t videos that all have the title &quot;Oldest Server In Minecraft!!!&quot; which he used constantly to refer to 2b2t. Other Youtubers started using the term in their videos as well.
===Behind the Meme===

THE OLDEST SERVER IN MINECRAFT became a meme against the Rusherfags who joined thinking that 2b2t was in fact the oldest server. The reason it is comical is that this fact is actually false as 2b2t is the fourth oldest server in Minecraft, started in December 2010, five months after multiplayer was released, with MinecraftOnline/Freedonia taking the first place, started on August 4th, 2010, mere hours after multiplayer was released. Zero.minr.org was created 2 days after multiplayer was released. It is unknown if Rusher did this out of lack of proper research or for clickbait. It is most likely the two combined. 
==Shitposts==
&quot;Shitpost&quot; is the common term on 2b2t and all around the internet for a post that contains a bunch of nonsense, weird things, and utterly useless information. These posts can be found on the [[Subreddit|2b2t subreddit]] , 4Chan, and even on the server chat. Server [[Queue Clogger Bots|bots]] usually spam shitposts on the server but people and groups can contribute to shitposting.
==Swastikas==
{{Autism}}[[File:005.png|thumb|220x220px|Hitlerwood (The last facepunch base)]][[File:002 converted-0.png|thumb|77x77px|Swastika Tower at spawn
]]

Swastikas are very present on 2b2t, being found from anywhere around spawn, to the edges of the 2b2t map. Swastikas are usually meant for shits and giggles (and not to be taken seriously), and are usually placed around griefed buildings and are sometimes used by some groups. The Swastika is the main symbol of [[the 4th Reich]] and has been used by other groups such as [[Team Veteran]] and [[Valkyria]] . Swastikas can either be made obsidian or can be map art. Some builds around 2b2t also have the swastika as a main part of the build. It is essentially used as a &quot;cuz I can&quot; thing.
[[File:Ridealong feb28 7.png|thumb|220x220px]]
[[File:Converted file 02be4933.png|thumb|220x220px]]

=== History ===
The first usage of the swastikas was from the [[4channers]] who brought the cancer of 2b2t as 4chan itself is a very cancerous community.
==SPAWN MASONS ARE RUINING THIS SERVER==

==The VoCo vs 4th Reich War==
[[File:Thumbnal.png|thumb|220x220px]]
The [[The Vortex Coalition|Vortex Coalition]] vs [[The 4th Reich|4th Reich War]] was an entirely fabricated stunt to drive attention to the two groups involved.

The idea was proposed by the then newly started group The 4th Reich. They came to The Vortex Coalition and proposed an idea: they would build a base that was meant to look like a VoCo base, and grief it. Then the VoCo could declare war on The 4th Reich and both groups could gain slight notoriety.

The 4th Reich most likely chose The Vortex Coalition due to their established prevalence on the server, The Vortex Coalition has said that they &quot;never expected The 4th Reich to gain the popularity they currently possess, but it doesn't matter because The Vortex Coalition will remain dominant on 2b2t for years to come as other groups die out and are formed.&quot;
==Tyrone is Popbob==
[[File:Download (4)-0.jpg|thumb|220x220px]]
Tyrone is Popbob is a [[Memes|2b2t meme]] that began when CatWhisperer420 posted a video on his channel labeled &quot;Tyrone is [[popbob]] 2b2t.org&quot; on February, 3rd, 2014. The video portrays Big Man Tyrone, a youtuber who has over 150K subscribers that originally posted the video, talking about himself being Popbob and how he has &quot;Autisms&quot;. Since then, Sato86 has made a parody in which each line is spoken by a different person from various different video and film clips, and HolyBruhBrine has made a parody in which alexa says the meme.

Until Rusher made his first video, it was the first thing that showed up if you looked up &quot;2b2t&quot;, making it many players' first introduction to the general weirdness of the community of the server.

=== Full Transcript ===
&quot;Too-Bee-Too-Tee-Dot-Org is the ''best'' minecraft ''server''. When you hear my name, you will ''know'' who I am. ''Everyone knows'' who I am. My ''name'' is on the server, it is, ''Popbob''. And I am ''always'' online, because I have ''nothing'' better to do. Here(?)/And(?) I have, ''Autisms''. ''Hausemaster'', want to build a base ''together''? ''Hausemaster''? Hause! Hause! Hause. Hause. Hause... Hause...&quot;

==Winst0n'd==
Winst0n'd is a [[Memes|2b2t meme]] and is used by griefers to indicate that they destroyed/greifed something. While the origin of the term is unknown, it was highly used by [[iTristan]] and his friends. The term is specifically used to indicate the use of TNT as Tristan would name his TNT Winst0n.
==Applebread==
Applebread is a 2b2t meme started by EyefulSin on the 2b2t subreddit sometime during July of 2016. EyefulSin eventually tried to kill the meme by stating that the meme was dead in September of 2016. The meme was popularized by [[househousehouse1]] on the subreddit. The meme is about 2b2t constantly eating [[Hausemaster's]] apple bread. Since this meme any reference to applebread has to do with Hause.
[[File:SqfalQVwhg7JcZC7jzHZwScYDhR2YwnXAPfxag1Y9mk.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Apple bread portrait]]
[[File:U8g48ymyl3fx.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Apple bread crafting recipe]]

=== Sub Reddit Post with the Original Meme ===
Someone ate the last piece of apple bread, this person knew Hause had wanted that last piece of bread but did not care as he opened his mouth wide and slid the bread into his abnormally dry mouth and onto his dusty, rough, hard, shriveled up Tongue He chew it right in front of Hause with his broken teeth, Hause's tears only pleased him as he kept on chewing through this moist and delicious bread. As he swallowed, Hause got very mad at the man and his naughty actions, so he went over to the man and politely chocked him to death, shaking him gently as his rotted finger nails carefully dug into his throat, he would not let go Despite the cries of help for Fit to save him, he finally passed out and Hause let go of him, spitting on him before walking away to make another loaf of apple bread. The man eventually woke up, and saw yet another last slice of apple bread .. and the cycle kept going on and on, except this was not a man, it was the server. The server was very selfish and kept eating the last slice of Hause's apple bread.

This is what happens when you are naughty server.
[[File:Download (6).jpg|thumb|220x220px|was apple bread involved in secret deals between hause master and rusher? meme]]

=== Attempted Killing of Meme Post ===
&quot;Let me explain what this actually means, first it was just some joke about Hause and choking his server because the naughty server would not stop eating his precious apple bread. &quot;Apple bread&quot; is literally a build on 2b2t I'm putting underground, it's a giant loaf of apple bread.

In other words, I am taking a giant shit on 2b2t.

Shitpost that started it: https://redd.it/4tc8bk

It is dead and I do not plan on using it again because it's not all that funny unless hausehausehause1 does something with it.&quot;

=== Continued Use ===
Despite attempts by the original creator, the meme continued to be (barely) used all over 2b's chat, reddit, and discord related servers. The meme now has several variants (ie bleach bread) and is used once in a while whenever people talk about Hause.
==DEDICATION MOTIVATION ACCELERATION==
[[File:06 (1).png|thumb|220x220px]]
DEDICATION MOTIVATION ACCELERATION is an old 2b2t meme that was used by [[Team Uberslugcake]] . The motto was spammed around chat in order to promote Team Uberslugcake. The meme slowly became less popular when Team Uberslugcake left 2b2t.
==Did You Know?==
The &quot;Did you know?&quot; meme (DYK for short) is one of the most popular memes on 2b2t. If you log onto the server you are almost sure to see several people sending periodic messages about various subjects beginning their message with &quot;Did you know?&quot;. Usually typed in green text.

=== History ===
The DYK meme was originally made popular on 2b2t by [[Coltsnid]] during the month of June in 2015. Coltsnid programmed the [[Vortex Coalition Bot|VoCo Bot]] to send messages related to VoCo, which always began with &quot;Did you know?&quot;

After several months of VoCo Bot being online, it became sort of a joke for people to make their own DYK messages. Eventually after the Rusher Invasion, several more people made similar bots using the DYK meme to post messages. The most notable of which would be Carl_Plemens and Touy9.

To this day, the meme is still regularly seen in chat from both [[Vortex Coalition|VoCo]] and non-VoCo players.
==Did you ever hear the tragedy of FitMC the Jew?==
{{TopKEK}}[[File:Ironic.png|thumb|290x290px|Is it possible to learn this power?]]
Did you ever hear the tragedy of [[FitMC]] the Jew?

I thought not.

It's not a story [[TheCampingRusher]] would tell you.

It's a 2b2t legend.

FitMC was a dark lord of the veterans, so powerful and so wise he could use his Youtube channel to influence the prepubescents to create shekels.

He had such a knowledge of spawn PVP that he could even keep the newfags he hated from joining.

Staged factions roleplaying is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.

He became so powerful, the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually of course he did.

Unfortunately, he taught his fanbase everything he knew, then the 2b2t community saw him turn into Rusher.

Ironic, he could save others from Youtubers, but not himself.
==Hause Master's Cocaine Addiction==
Hausemaster's Cocaine Addiction is a [[Memes|2b2t meme]] where people make fun of [[Hausemaster]] . The joke is that Hausemaster never does anything on or with 2b2t because he is always high on cocaine.
==Popbob's dome==
The Popbob's Dome is a mildly popular [[meme]] on 2b2t. It stems from [[Fit]]'s video on [[Passie Town]], in which he mentioned that [[Popbob]] used to rebuild the dome he first build in Passie Town in every base he griefed or built. It's unknown if it's true or not, but many fitfags (Rushers who ditched [[TheCampingRusher]] and became Fit's fans, often identifying as &quot;[[Veterans]] &quot; despite being newfags) started believing that the presence of a dome in a build indicates that Popbob has visited it at some point, and felt obligated to tell everyone that they found something Popbob built or griefed whenever they happened to find one. Some other players found this funny and started commenting about Popbob in caps every time someone posted a picture of a dome on [[subreddit|the 2b2t subreddit]], creating the meme.
==TOBE TOTE suc==
the ToBe ToTe (suc) meme, born on the [[Subreddit|official 2b2t subreddit]] , involved players spelling &quot;ToBe ToTe&quot; in, on and around seemingly random places, around the world. Some were edits, and some were done in real life.

The title of each post either proclaimed the author had found the sign while visiting a place, created the sign, or referred to the meme directly.

It died down mid-may 2017.

== I recognize that (block), see you soon ==
I recognize that (block), see you soon, was a meme started in 2017 due to ChromeCrusher‘s coordinate exploit. This was due to the fact that the exploit allowed for the user to determine the exact location of a piece of bedrock if shown in a picture. The meme originally started with “I recognize that piece of bedrock, see you soon”, obviously meaning the player will come and destroy your base. It can be commonly found in reddit comment sections with pictures of gameplay.

==Heil Fitler==
Heil Fitler is a 2b2t [[memes|meme]] that was created during [[the Rusher War]] . It is used by the fans of [[FitMC]] and other random people. It is primarily used to spam Fit's stream chats or spam in 2b2t chat to praise or laugh at the [[Team Veteran ]] leader. It is obviously dubbed from &quot;Heil Hitler&quot; by replacing &quot;Hit&quot; with &quot;Fit&quot;. The meme has no significant racial meaning as it is simply to joke about Fit. The meme originated because of the large presence of Nazi memes on 2b2t, which tend to joke about the Nazis.
==2b2t Doomsday==
[[File:2b2t Doomsday.jpg|thumb|220x220px|One of the 2b2t Doomsday clocks.]]
The 2b2t Doomsday is a meme event that is spreading across the 2b2t Subreddit. It predicts the end of 2b2t with actual events that occurred in the server. It predicts the eventual forced resetting of 2b2t, be it through a backdoor or a game-breaking glitch.

It is unknown whether this is actually true or not, but it is highly assumed that this is all a meme. However, it is highly unlikely that any of these ending events will occur due to the Apocalypse Exploit being patched and Day 32767 being completely false as a Minecraft world can last for 14 billion years.
[[File:Mayan End.jpg|thumb|220x220px|A 2b2t Doomsday clock based off the Mayan Calendar.]]

=== Predictions ===

==== 2b2t Doomsday Clock ====
* Map files lost ('''Finished''')
* Map limit reached ('''Finished''')
* Maps deleted ('''Finished''')
* Coord Exploit ('''Finished''')
* The fr1kin Machine ('''Patched''')
* Shulker Boxes Disabled
* Day 32767 arrives and time can no longer move further. ('''False, day 50 000 has already passed''')
* An Account Exploit possibly similar to the Player Data Corruption of 2011 or the OP Account Hacking in 2016
* Chunks would stop generating
* Chest limit
* Backdoor
* Chunk Limit
* Server shut down/reset.

==== The Mayan Calendar of 2b2t ====
* 2b2t Begins ('''Finished''')
* TheCampingRusher invasion ('''Finished''')
* Destruction of Fitlantis/The revelation of the ChromeCrusher Exploit ('''Finished''')
* 11/11 Dupe ('''Finished''')
* Map Limit ('''Finished''')
* Maps Destroyed ('''Finished''')
* Passage of Time ends (Day 32767/[[the Apocalypse Exploit]]) ('''Day 32767 is false''') ('''Exploit patched''')
* 2b2t would reset.
==Kings/Queens of 2b2t==
Kings/Queens of 2b2t is a term used by players to make someone known and seem powerful. The title is a [[meme]] and is completely subjective as players may or may not agree with that person being the king. People usually claim to be the king of 2b2t if they have done a lot on the server, become powerful, or just overall known throughout the server. However, people have actually claimed to be king of 2b2t by doing nothing but spamming chat and people actually believed that they were the king of 2b2t (either to stop their spam or actually believe it). It is simply a meme as anyone can claim the title and it is not an award given by [[Hausemaster]] . It is also a meme because no one can truly be a king/queen on 2b2t as it is an anarchy server.

The common spam phrase is &quot;(insert name) IS THE KING OF 2B2T, UMAD NEWFAGS, UMAD&quot; and other variations of this.
=== People who have been called king/queen ===

* [[Chrisleighton]] (First person to call themselves king)
* [[SnackyNorph]] (as a joke)
* [[Pyrobyte]]
* [[xcc2]]
* [[popbob]]
* [[iTristan]]
* [[OreMonger]] (and other people at King's landing (a hub of the meme))
* [[Jared2013]]
* [[Sato86]]
* [[Branillon]]
* [[SmackAttack86]]
* Several others (mainly old and midfags)

== 2b2tPlaYeR News ==
2b2tPlaYeR News is a fitfag, meme and autism source news outlet. Created by 5 year old, 2b2tPlAyErNeWs, has been posting &quot;news&quot; about his best friend Fit, and forgetting who Sato is. 
[[File:2b2t News Fitmc|thumb|330x330px|The Epitome of Fitfaggery]]In episode 1,

2b2tPlaYeR News talked about his best friend [[Fit]] and how he is a [[Spawn Masons|Spawn Mason]]. He also talks about his steams and the &quot;anarchy 2b2t server anarchy minekwaft&quot;. Sato''... Whats a sato again? I forgot.'' Alphacomputer is now a god. We must now bow down to alphacomputer because of &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;2b2tPlaYer News&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;2b2tPLaYer News also talked about not getting the future client because virus got installed onto computer but virus ''deleter'' (most likely Protegent 360) deleted virus.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;In the end, Fit is strange. &lt;/span&gt;

In episode 2,

&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;2b2tPlaYer News talks about how FitMC was apparently banned off of &quot;tvteetee&quot;. He claims that FitMC hasn't played in a while despite making a &quot;life stream&quot; a day ago. His Xbox one friend, the single best source of 2b2t, has stated that he was banned. The kiddie mentioned that he wished that FitMC makes more &quot;2bee2tee videoooos&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;

== Looking for a bounty hunter ==
Looking for a bounty hunter is a meme started by the user xxNavi on July 2nd, 2018 on the [[subreddit]] who was actually looking for someone to kill AlphaComputer for killing and stealing his stuff. This was obviously ridiculed and made into a meme where several users posted that they were in need of a bounty hunter to kill a player (usually a well known or memed player) for a reward.

This is an example video made by DrEnderPickles: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5GH8Th_uDk

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="965">Mines is a relatively small 2b2t YouTuber, who has done a number of base tour videos. He joined in 2013 (?), but was not very active till after [[TheCampingRusher]] came on the server. He used to make videos showing the places he found, but as times progressed and people saw his work, he got invited to do base tours more often.

His tour videos are usually followed by a video cinematic of the base, showing off shaders and his video editing skills. This made his channel grow quite quickly and at one point he was the main base tour youtuber.

On several occasions, Mines has received harsh criticism for appearing uninformed about historical bases he has toured. He also made a video about an elytra exploit, that made a lot of people able to use it and might have been the reason for the server disabling the elytra. Mines got a lot of hate because of this and eventually became inactive again.

== ''Mokuzai Island'' ==
A little bit more info about the place:

Mokuzai Island is the result of a [[spawn]] adventure on my 2nd account. I decided to attempt another spawn escape and live as a hermit on an island, and this is the result. I did not get help from anyone and farmed everything by myself, including actually finding those [[Alpha Leaves|alpha leaves]] laying on the ground in an old chunk. yeah. There were no [[Duplication Glitches|dupes]] used either.

Because the base is pretty close to spawn, &lt;em&gt;I will invite players to the place over time&lt;/em&gt;.
You are allowed to come over, say hi, but not stay forever. I will only accept gifts in small quantities too in order to not mess up the hermit thing i have going there. So if you think I might know you or you're just a good person I could trust and want to see the place for yourself, feel free to drop me a message.

Hope y'all enjoy. Oh and for everyone wondering: &quot;Mokuzai&quot; means wood in japanese.

== ''History and Design Storyline'' ==
May 5th, arrived on the island, made shelter

[[File:Scene-598.png|none|thumb|831x831px]]

== ''Conclusion'' ==
This is one of a kind solo builds at the moment started a finished by Prismary and is very close to spawn so might have a very short life span. I could have posted the world download but arent still because it stands. As I have the download now, I'd say I consider my self, Sniper231996 and Prismary as the only current basemates. Thank you for reading Prismary's little story. Hope you had a good time!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="532">Mitch was a youtuber doing a 2b2t series along with [[TheCampingRusher|Rusher]]. They did most episodes together. Mitch, despite being in most of Rushers 2b2t episodes, has never fought anyone major like [[Fit]] or [[NedaT]]. 

In episode 18, Mitch was almost killed. He logged, and as expected, the hunter lava- and block-trapped him. Rusher had to save him once the hunter was gone.

NFE was a spawnbase at -400 800 that lasted for about 4 years. NFE stands for it's coordinates, -400 800. Today, the majority of the spawnbase is encased in a giant [[lavacast]] , but there are some features that can be made out, and are still standing today.[[File:B571B060-D71B-4E09-98C1-F8A833A1FB0A.jpeg|thumb|220x220px]]
Due to it being only 1.2k away from spawn it was easily griefed but took 2 years due to being defended by xxc2 and others

== History ==

NFE was started in early 2011 by Pimpmastaflex and possibly other anonymous [[Facepunch]] players. It started as a castle and was presumed to be abandoned by xcc when he arrived at it. [[xcc2]] repaired the castle and a player named [[alex02028]] continued to expand the area surrounding the castle. Months later, many players had heard of the base around the server and was a popular attraction for new and old players alike. xcc and alex02028 offered food and gear to new players who came to NFE. x0XP and Cold_Storage77 eventually aided alex and xcc in defending the base and x0XP named the base. Due to the base's popularity, NFE was griefed and repaired many, many times. 

As xcc2 himself recalls, &quot;The griefing took many forms, some much more creative than others. One player offered to stay and build at the base, but instead created the first lavacast I had ever seen, right in front of the castle. He thought it was funny, so I waited until he logged out (ontop of the cast) and I quickly took it down. When he next logged in, he fell from his logout height and died right in front of me, blaming me for his death. I took his gear, and used the cobble from the lavacast to construct the gatehouse on the front of the castle.&quot;

== History ==
Napkin0fTruth joined the server due to Rusher's video and being a close friend of Rusher. At the time, Napkin was Rusher's factions rival in his [[The Archon|factions]] show that he had on his channel. So when Napkin joined 2b2t, he continued to play this role and tracked Rusher's travels on the server. Due to his false rival mentality, he decided to join [[Team Veteran]] due to their animosity to Rusher, believing that they were simply trying to be Rusher's competition and rivals. However, he did not realize that they were actually serious in their plight to kick Rusher off the server and all his fans. Fit created a video in which he asked Napkin who he truly fought for. 

Eventually, after accidentaly joining Team Veteran, Napkin left the group after him and Charlyy were attacked by a band of Vets and joined the [[Peacekeepers]]. Since then, Napkin co worked heavily with Rusher and gave him and MrMitch their first sets of god gear due to his access to Peacekeeper dupe stashes made during the [[Duplication Glitches|Minecart Dupes of the Summer of 2016]].  He stated that the peacekeepers were more against the Veterans, despite the original intention being to be against everyone. He also gave several coordinates to Rusher and has personally walked out to bases for Rusher in order for Rusher to tour bases with his account.

During [[the Rusher War]], Napkin's personal base was eventually found by Team Veteran and destroyed during [[Spawn Incursions|the 4th Incursion]]. Napkin participated in several battles during the War.

Napkin eventually left the server after Rusher's first departure from the server, along with several other Rushers and most of the hierarchy of [[Team Rusher]]. He eventually posted a video leaking the coordinates of his personal dupe stash as he stated he won't need it anymore, which was raided the day of the video's release.

Neda T is a 2b2t youtuber and the founder / leader of [[Team Aurora]].

== History ==
Neda T first joined 2b2t on July 19th, 2016. She made a video about herself traveling through the server on the highways and random areas. Now, her support for[[ Team Veteran]] is kind of confusing due to the fact that early, on she did wear the Veteran shield but then joined [[the Resistance]] despite PvP_Comboz killing her in a video. Eventually, she decided to join the Resistance and killed a Veteran so she probably went [[Team Rusher|Pro-Rusher]] until the [[Offtopia]] fiasco.

Neda went on to be a very high ranking Resistance member being in almost every Resistance fight and gained respect by [[CorruptedUnicorn]] and his fellow co-leader SoulFood. During her times in the Resistance, she met [[TheJadhya]] who was part of [[Team Rusher]] . The two became good friends and allies as Rusher and Resistance alliance was pretty good for the most part of the Rusher War. Her hate for[[ the 4th Reich]] also began during her Resistance days as the Reich was talking shit about her and other things on the discord, which offended her. She conducted a raid against them with her fellow allies but her being on a Pro-Veteran group's discord seemed very fishy.

Eventually, Neda T got involved with Offtopia, a well respected Veteran member. She became a spy for Team Veteran and insided several [[The Resistance|Resistance]] bases which were destroyed by [[the 4th Incursion]] crew. Completely confused by what happened, many Resistance members went on the hunt for the traitor. Corrupted and SoulFood discovered that it was Neda and so they kicked her out of the group.

Neda T then went on to found[[ Team Aurora]] , a group meant to undo the damage caused by The Resistance and to become an ally of Team Veteran. NedaT invited a few of her former Resistance members, ie PvP_Comboz, as well as some other players. Her group began conducting attacks on several Pro-Rusher groups, including [[the Peacekeepers]], [[the Resistance|the&amp;nbsp;Resistance]] , and [[the 4th Reich]] .

== Post-War ==
After the Rusher War, Neda lead her group to war with the Peacekeepers and the 4th Reich, as the Resistance began giving up on their initiative and several members left. She has streamed many of her adventures on 2b2t, and played a role in [[The Rusher War]]. She eventually teamed up with [[Offtopia]], coming along on his adventures and helping him with [[Offtopia's Drain|The Drain]]. She has become incredibly hated by many players due to her personality and alliance with Offtopia. Many people believe she is manipulating Offtopia, but there is little to no evidence of this.

[[File:Maxresdefault-1496964765.jpg|thumb|220x220px]]

== Behind The Meme ==
The meme is a comical picture of Neda holding a shoe above her head. The meme was created when Neda was doing a livestream with facecam and decided to put a shoe on top of her head in order to please a fan. This eventually spread throughout the 2b2t community and being posted throughout several 2b2t medias like discords and youtube channels (ie [[the 4th Reich|the 4th Reich's]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9023">[[File:Download.png|thumb|272x272px|The Nether Highway Group's Banner]]'''The Nether Highway Group, '''aka as &quot;the Diggers&quot;, is a group of players formed in early January 2017 by the group's leader [[Byrnsy]]. The goal of the group was to reach the 2b2t's World Border by completing the X+ Nether Highway. Later on the group built a base along the X+ border, known as Point Dory, and eventually began digging the X+Z+ Nether Highway in hopes of reaching 2b2t's World Corner. 

The group has created several bases along the X+ and X+Z+ highway. Some of which include the many grinders and milestones along the highway. They were also the builders of the famed Point Dory base, which was one of the largest bases on 2b2t to date. It also stands as the base with the largest player count at 30 members who based there during it's peak.

The group also took full advantage of first and second Donkey Dupe, which allowed the group to complete the X+ Nether Highway and to construct their base Point Dory. They were also one of the first groups to discover the Crafting Dupe.

Their goal of completing the X+ Nether Highway was reached on March 26th, 2017. Since then, the group has completed Point Dory, and begun digging a new highway to the corner on May 20th 2017. The highway starts at the end of the X+ Highway (X:3.750.000) and goes Z+ to the ++ World Corner.

The dig to the corner was given the same treatment as the dig to the X+ border was. Every so often the group would create milestones, grinders, and bases along the highway. 5 months later and the X+Z+ highway to the world corner had been completed. On October 8th 2017, the group had completed their goal. 

Ever since the group has split up and each member has gone their own way. There is no more plans for future projects that this group will undertake.

== History ==
On December 14 2016, Byrnsy created a post on the 2b2t subreddit, that detailed his plans to attempt to reach 2b2t's X+ Border or die trying. Every 10% of the journey Byrnsy created a post updating the subreddit on the X+ Nether Highway's progress. Whilst originally the journey was solo, [https://imgur.com/a/NgU9E these posts] began receiving a lot attention from many players who, while not directly invited, began walking down the X+ Nether Highway in hopes of helping Brynsy reach his goal.  

By February 5th 2017, Byrnsy had a group of around 10 players who had joined him in his journey to the world border. He created the official X+ Digging Discord which had open invites for anyone who wanted participate in digging the highway. This discord would soon become The Nether Highway Group.

Several times throughout the journey, the group created bases to take a break from digging the highway. The major ones include the Oasis Outpost, 15 Mil Town, and 24 Mil base. Although many small bases, dupe stashes, and grinders exists at the milestones the group created every 25k along the highway. 
[[File:V4S7SQS.png|thumb|268x268px|A screenshot of some of the members at Point Nemo.]]
After many months of digging and basing along the X+ Highway, the group completed the X+ Highway on March 26th 2017 with over 30 people aiding the dig at least once. The Highway stretched from 0,0 nether to 2b2t's World Border at 3.750.000, 0 nether. After which the group spent less than a week constructing the World Border base Point Nemo, until it was griefed by Chunkr, Nordic93, and BabbaJ. After the grief, the group moved onto a private location to begin construction of Point Dory. 

Point Dory remained under construction for 3 months until a controversy arose after Fit toured Point Dory without the group's permission. This controversy, along with the drama from Fit, lead to one of Point Dory's members, xxq, into leaking the coordinates of Point Dory, which resulted in its destruction. 

Immediately afterwards, the group began a new project: digging the X+Z+ Highway all the way to 2b2t's World Corner. The group has since finished the X+Z+ dig on October 8th 2017. 

After an official statement from Byrnsy that no formal corner base would be established most of the groups most active members left off in various directions to create their own projects. Some left the corner entirely while others fucked off deep into the 20 millions to construct bases and safe havens to create map art which due to their deep location and secrecy will likely never be found without some type of exploit.  

While several pearls were set and some pear loading accounts do exist the sheer range required for the group to return to the corner and regroup is simply not feasible without another major movement exploit. This means the group is effectively disbanded.     

== World Border ==
[[File:Lb4TLXI.png|thumb|282x282px|The signs left by Pyrobyte and iTristan]]
On March 26th, 2017, the World Border has been reached by the Nether Highway Group. However, upon reaching the world border, it was revealed that [[pyrobyte]] and [[iTristan]] reached the World Border during 2013 with the use of some form of teleportation. Items and signs were found left by them beyond the World Border. They were preserved by the group.

Afterwards the construction of Point Nemo began. Fit finished his border journey and toured Point Nemo. Several days after Point Nemo was completely griefed by BabbaJ, Chunkr, and Nordic93.  

== World Corner ==
[[File:X+ Z+ Corner .png|thumb|256x256px]]
On October 8th, 2017 the X+ Digging group slammed head first into the X+ Z+ world corner. A monument was erected at the location which included an underground meeting room with chairs of each of the primary diggers. A few copies of the 6th and final Wise words of T were distributed that included a commemoration to the border crew. 

There are no plans for a group base at the corner nor are there plans to finish the loop to the Z+ Axis

== Fit Controversy ==
After many months of constructing Point Dory, Fit had managed to get a world download of the base. He then created a [https://youtu.be/YAokAuz-1UA tour video] of the base without the group's full permission. This drew huge amounts of attention to Point Dory, which put drama and stress on the group, and eventually lead to xxq leaking the coordinates to Point Dory on the 2b2t subreddit.

Fit was criticized heavily for being responsible for the destruction of Point Dory. This lead many players to discuss the ethics of Fit touring bases on 2b2t without the permission of the builders, and lead to an outcry by people who had their bases destroyed due to Fit touring their base without consent. It is often compared to what happened at The Drain.

He was also criticized for disrespecting many members in the group and inaccurately representing the group in his videos regarding the X+ Highway.

Valkyria

THEJudge's group}}Offtopia is a well known and respected oldfag on the server. He has been playing on 2b2t since the [[Forum Massacre Period|Facepunch Era]] way back in 2011-2012.
[[File:Photo (3).jpg|thumb|220x220px|Offtopia's Youtube Profile Picture]]

== History ==
He was part of [[Judge's group|THEJudge's group]] and helped people at spawn. He would hire players from both [[the Facepunch Republic]] and the [[4channers]] . When the group disbanded, Offtopia moved on to help out [[Jaang]] with [[the Valley of Wheat]] . He spent his days protecting the Valley and killing anyone who would not replant the crops and inviting his previous comrades from THEJudgeHolden's group, such as [[xcc2]] and [[passie05]]. Eventually, the time of the [[Valkyria]]ns arrived and so Offtopia went on to join them. He participated in all three of the first incursions. When Valkyria disbanded, Offtopia went on to help several of his ex-Valkyrian friends build bases. He eventually joined [[Fit]], one of his third incursion comrades, against [[ The Rusher War|the Rusher invasion]] and became a well respected general among Team Veteran.

== Post-War Activity and Drama ==
[[File:Download (3).jpg|thumb|318x318px|Offtopia's Skin]]
Offtopia eventually went on to lose contact with Fit and become distant from [[Team Veteran]], because he thought Fit leaked the [[Crystal Islands]] coords to [[Rusher]], that he was a sellout, and the belief that Team Veteran was not the best way to get rid of the Rushers. He moved on to start the construction of [[The Drain]] with [[Team Aurora]] members. Fit wanted to tell him that these are false accusations but could not contact Offtopia anywhere. Fit eventually made a video touring the Drain, in which he found using the Coord Exploit of 2016, in an attempt to make contact with Offtopia. Offtopia eventually began to panic that the Drain was compromised on a video he posted, however Fit declared he would not give away the coords and that he just wanted to get his attention. Fit made a video about this whole drama on his youtube channel. The Drain was eventually griefed by the [[4th Reich]], which found it using different methods and without the help of Fit.

== Summermelon ==
At some time between [[The Drain]] being griefed up July 2017, he has been apart of a base called [[Summermelon]]. One of the members of the base leaked the coordinates of [[Rocket City|Rocket Town ]]. Fit then discovered Summermelon and destroyed the base with the help of AlphaComputer, ChromeCrusher and others to avenge [[Rocket City|Rocket Town]] (even though it really turned out to be another way for Fit to make money on YouTube).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1565">The Drain was the base of [[Offtopia]] and [[willyroof]] which was constructed during the waning days of [[the Rusher War]]. Offtopia based with high ranking members of[[ Team Aurora]] who helped with the construction. The base was toured by [[FitMC]] on October 22nd, 2016, without Offtopia's permission. He was able to find it by using the bedrock exploit of late 2016, which had been used to find the location of his [[Fitlantis]] base beforehand. After Fit's video, Offtopia declared that the base was compromised and it was the end. Fit then made a video explaining that he would not reveal the coordinates. However, Offtopia knew Fit had used the bedrock exploit and that it was only a matter of time before it leaked and someone else used Fit's video to locate the base. Eventually the 4th Reich found the base, due to Fit &quot;accidentally&quot; publishing the coords in his &quot;Fitlantis&quot; World Download, and they griefed it. The base can be downloaded [http://www.mediafire.com/file/97hz4ue764s4wdb/FITLANTIS+WORLD+DOWNLOAD.zip here (It says fitlantis download, but you spawn at the drain)]{{Space_Valkyria|title1 = The Drain|built = September 21st, 2016 (Started) October 1st, 2016 (Completed)|destroyed = November 11th, 2016|builder = |griefer = |dimension = |coordinates = X: 57,457 Y: 45 Z: 70,265|builder(s) = Offtopia, willyroof, a few Team Aurora members, others|griefer(s) = The 4th Reich}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1009">The Old Spawn Road, also known as the Non-Axis road, is a small road that does not run on any axis and stretches for ~13,000 blocks. It is one of the oldest roads on the server and is special in that it is almost made entirely out of cobblestone rather than the usual obsidian. It is also unique in the fact that it does not stay in a straight path and it twists and turns. The road, along with most other highways, access roads, and roads, was made and restored by several players.

The old spawn road was built by a player named LegitYarik - [https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/show-your-creation/screenshots/2270399-8-thousand-block-long-road-on-an-anarchy-server his post on Minecraft forums]

The road was completely griefed by Armorsmith in the begining of 2018. Armorsmith himself would later build his wrath at the begining of the road, located at -3500 300.

It was one of the very few independent bases during the times of the [[The Facepunch War|Facepunch conflict]]. It was also where [[Judge's group]] was founded.

== History ==
When THEJudgeHolden began to play 2b2t, he went out to found Old Town. He eventually invited Offtopia and the two began construction. Offtopia did not build as much as Judge did but instead  invited more players as the months past. Offtopia eventually invited jdw99666 and Elocdrof from spawn within the first month, who were clueless newfags at the time. 

Eventually, Elecdrof began inviting real life friends, like marksmen77 and willyroof. This made the group have a solid six members and continued this for a while until the group decided to invite jdw's friend, bubbakennedy and square_digger. 

The group was eventually attacked by [[Popbob]] in November of 2011, when he used his [[Backdoors|backdoor]] to destroy a large portion of the base using infinite TNT and his teleportation methods.  

The base was eventually abandoned by [[Judge's group]] and the group continued to be together up until 2013, during the rise of [[Valkyria|Valk]].

== Architecture ==
The base was very retro in style, as it was built during the Beta days of minecraft. Similar to many of the older towns on 2b2t, Judge's group only had a limited amount of selection in terms of blocks and so it was mainly built with sandstone, wood, cobblestone, mossy cobble stone, and stone brick. Offtopia also made a netherack home as he liked to set them on fire as netherack burns indefinitely. He also built a large wall around the base in order to keep mobs out, as back in 2011, 2b2t's mob spawn rate was much higher.
[[File:Capture-1497890818.PNG|thumb|220x220px]]

== Trivia ==
* Willyroof owns a dog that is technically considered the oldest living minecraft dog on the server, and possibly in the entirety of minecraft, who has been living for +5 years. He saved the dog from the town and brought it to [[Judge's group|the Judge's group's]] escapade to 1 million.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2903">Omega City was build by the player called Caviyaz/Putin. Its among one of the biggest bases currently known on 2b.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYyBqD8n19c&amp;t Video made in Omega]

== History ==
Omega City was founded in early July 2016 by Caviyaz. The base used to be a small outpost for Caviyaz and his friends to stay at so they could be close to spawn. However the base grew bigger and bigger and at some point it was a propper base. However after a few months his friends left to build bases of there own, leaving Caviyaz with a whole base to himself. He started expanding and the idea of a group came to mind, a group that would not interfere with the 2b2t Community (nobody knows the groups name but they are mostly referred to as &quot;Omegans&quot;).

After a 6 month period of isolationism Caviyaz invited the first outsider to the city. His name was mines and they met some time before on The Lonely Island. After [[mines]] came to the city the place grew rapidly and some time later Caviyaz invited Enjoy and Niftyrobo.

Around may the city was fully terraformed and completely packed with housing and mega-builds. They ran out of land and had to start building into the ocean. Some notable building such as, The Omega meeting hall, The Rainbow, The Statue of Liberty and the Cathedral all where build on such reclaimed land.

A week bevore the city fell the [[Spawn Masons|Spawnmason]] found the place on accident (Found by [[Hermeticlock]] ).

On July, 18 2017 the city was destroyed by the players: mrking039, CasualCocaine, and Pekee

*EDIT*

dae1250 and vrh had nothing to do with the grief of Omega City it has been confirmed by mrking039

The base had a unique style because it was mostly made out of colored clay (Terracotta). This made the base very colorful. It's also a base that is build in roughtly the same style and is very consistent. The roads where made out of default hardend clay and there where a lot of streetlights, flowers and canals. With the whole city suspended from the sea it resulted in a very sleek walls.

-Drewbookman, August 10th, 2017

OreMonger was an [[Social Classes|Oldfaggot]] on 2b2t who played between the years 2011 and 2016. He was a well-known griefer.

== History ==
OreMonger joined 2b2t in 2011 and settled relatively close to Spawn with his real-life friend, KingSplash. In 2012 he raided and destroyed Thefox's base at https://i.imgur.com/7i2KFdE.png .This sparked Thefox's longtime and very vocal hate. For the first 3 years he played with chat off and concentrated on playing minecraft. In this time he spent 50% of his time building and 50% of his time searching for bases to loot. In 2014 he started reading and participating in chat, and took on a public anti-bigotry stance, including using the username BigotryisBad. Oremonger's base lasted several years, until 2014. In 2014 Oremonger found Zach3379's dupe stash at Snacky's old Library. As the story goes, Oremonger found Javazon already raiding the base. Managed to kill Javazon, loot 90% of the dupe site before javazon got back (read as had a bed set within 40 minute travels). At this point javazon was very upset and was able to convince some that Oremonger and javazon were working together. Some even thought the two users were the same person. At this point Javazon hit Kammtown and a few other locations and was able to convince  xcc2, Jacktherippa, stormtroopah, jared2013, iTristan, and Pyrobyte that Oremonger was working with Javazon or was him. Now none of that is true. So.. Popbob and 2 others had Oremonger's 2011 base coords from back in 2013 when they got 1000s of coords via the thunder exploit before it was disabled.

Following the destruction of his base, he spent months creating new bases which, all were found via coord hacks and got destroyed. At this point most of racist / edgy / bigots of the server disliked him, and he was often harrassed by racists and bigots, which stemmed from his public opposition to racism and bigotry sometime in 2014. Late in 2014, popbob and iTristan used hacks found one of OreMonger's bases and asked to base with him. He accepted their offer, buying time to move items from his base, a few days later destroyed the base himself. However, when [[Branillon]] invited OreMonger to [[King's Landing]], he found friendship and enjoyed his final few months on 2b2t with relatively no issues.

OreMonger decided to quit in late April, 2016 and played on constantiam for about a year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2698">[[File:Pacific.png|thumb|354x354px]]

== Background ==
Pacific Heights was a group base founded by [http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/Lifeisgood72 Lifeisgood72] on November 21, 2016 and destroyed by [[0xymoron]] and [[Slappnbadkids]] on January 4, 2017. The base was founded around the time of the 20/20 dupe. The base was originally supposed to be a 1900s wild western town, however the dupe changed Lifeisgood72's ambitions. Having unlimited access to previously hard to get blocks such as quartz, he decided to build a futuristic city. Because the city was built westward, it was named Pacific, and because the buildings were tall, it was named Heights. Pacific Heights is also the name of a well known neighborhood in Los Angeles, California. After the base was a month old, Lifeisgood72 decided to start inviting players.

== Builds ==
[[File:C1npa9N.png|thumb|260x260px]]
The base was  futuristic themed so the builds are built accordingly. Using both contemporary and post-contemporary buildings for reference, the builds were very unique for 2b2t. Some builds were inspired by real life buildings. Others were straight up copies of real life buildings, such as the Burj Al Arab from Dubai. The road layout was similar to that of Chicago where they create a strict grid-like patten, where multiple buildings are placed per city block. Highways with Minecarts, along with an underground subway system that took you to different parts of the city were started, but never finished.

== Demolition ==
On January 1st, Donster arrived at the base after being invited by [[Lifeisgood72]] with one plan in mind: to grief it. At the time, he had a Vault Clone server and a world download of a base that few people knew about would be perfect for him. He took the world download, uploaded a few cinematics of the base his YouTube channel, then gave [[0xymoron]] the coordinates. [[0xymoron]] invited [[Slappnbadkids]] to grief the base. On January 4th, 2017, Pacific Heights had been griefed, ending the relatively short lifespan of the base that was home to 6 people.
[[File:TxVWtet.png|thumb|329x329px]]

== Members ==
The members of the base include:
* Lifeisgood72
* Rojos
* Sevorus (Commited suicide on March 1st, 2017. He built the stone building with the grey stained glass, you can check it out on the world download. I didn't know you that well, but Rest in Piece, Josh.)
* Gizmonster
* Im_Mary
* Donster
The world download of the base can be found [http://www.mediafire.com/file/2asbabrbmiut5ca/PacificHeights+%282%29.zip here].

A PvP group founded by ImmortalYogurt and RobMaster21 with a few bases and a few members. Their most notable base was [[Celestia]] but it has been griefed. They used to fight a lot at spawn and have a ranking system; (leader, member, trusted member, and recruit). They are somewhat of a sub-group to the peacekeepers, (a secession happened due to an inside)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1330">[[Passie05]] is famous for all of his castles, which he has been  activly building since 2011. His most famous castles were some of his oldest, like the one at [[Ziggy Town|Ziggy]] and [[Passie Town|Passie town]]. A description of most of his castles will be given.

Ziggy Castle - A castle made put of red wool and birch planks, stylized as a Russian orthodox church at Moscow.

Squid Castle (The Castle at Passie Town) - A very primitive looking castle, made out of stone bricks and netherrack on the roof.

Icey Castle - Arguably Passie05's most famous castle, a castle made out of ice and jungle planks.

Green Castle - Similar to Ziggy Castle, but made out of green wool and spruce planks, and a whole lot larger.

Pyramid Castle - A castle with proportions similar to a german expressionist film, making it look like a pyramid. Made out of oak planks and yellow wool.

There are also some minor castles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="730">Passie05 was a player that joined in mid 2011 from [[Chezhead]]'s [[Facepunch Republic]] post. Passie05 is most notable for all the castles he has built over the years. His most famous castles are some of his oldest, the ones at Ziggy and Passie town (The latter being named after him, duh). Passie05 has made more castles since then with even more complex design. During the destruction of the [[Valley of Wheat]], Passie05 attempted to rebuild the valley several times, but failed. Passie05 even runs a Youtube channel, but it seems like he deleted all of his videos. His youtube account can be seen [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyTMrBNaLH5MCSOWVrRNNEg here].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5082">Pig Spawners were an item that, prior to their removal, were quite commonly encountered on 2b2t.

== History ==
In Minecraft, the default state of a mob spawner is a pig spawner (for some reason). If you use the creative inventory, the give command, or an exploit to obtain a spawner in your inventory, when placed it will spawn pigs, unless you right click on it with a spawn egg to change the mob that it spawns, or use the setblock command to place a spawner of a specific type.

Because of this, whenever 2b2t players used [[backdoors]] or other exploits to obtain spawner items, the only thing they could spawn was pigs. This was not entirely a bad thing, as pigs drop pork, which is one of the best food items in the game when cooked; and they can also be ridden, which is especially useful if you are using a hacked client that lets you move extremely fast while riding an entity such as a pig. Pig spawners were obtained and distributed by various players many times over the course of 2b2t history, but it wasn't until 2017, after several notable [[Duplication Glitches|dupes]] occurred, that they became very common.

When the [[Donkey Dupe|donkey dupe]] and llama dupes happened, a large amount of players got extremely large quantities of pig spawners through the dupes. Groups such as the [[The Peacekeepers|Peacekeepers]] and [[Spawn Masons|Spawnmasons]] used pig spawners extensively through the following months, using them in their bases (such as [[Rocket Town]]) and putting them all over frequently traveled areas for players to use to obtain food and a means of quick travel.

During the summer of 2017 you could hardly go more than a few hundred blocks in [[The Nether|the nether]], especially within a few thousand blocks of 0,0, without encountering a pig spawner surrounded by grass blocks, with pigs wandering around in the area. At one point, in one of the more impressive accomplishments of the Peacekeepers, the nether highways near the center of the nether were completely encased in pig spawners and given grass block flooring, creating long corridors densely packed with thousands upon thousands of pigs.

== Removal ==
The age of the pig spawners did not last long. Even before [[Hausemaster]] removed them, most of the pig spawners in the nether were destroyed by players. Eventually it became far more common to find a patch of grass where a pig spawner once was than a pig spawner itself. The ones in [[The Overworld|the overworld]], just on the other sides of portals along the nether highways, tended to last longer, but eventually most of those were destroyed as well. Pig spawners very far out, or far from any axis, survived, but only until they were removed by Hausemaster himself.

When Hausemaster introduced a plugin to remove pig spawners, it caused a rather large outcry, not only because the pig spawners were removed, but because other spawners were being removed as well. For a few days, if you loaded a chunk with any kind of spawner in it, not just a pig spawner, it would be deleted. Hausemaster quickly fixed the problem so that only pig spawners would get removed, but a lot of damage was done and many mob grinders were rendered useless.

Because pig spawners are only removed upon loading the chunk they are in, or upon opening a chest or other storage item with them in it, it is possible that there are still pig spawners out there, in chunks that have not been loaded by anyone since Hausemaster removed them, and in chests that have remained unopened ever since. 

For example: on both the +X | +X +Z Highway and -Z highways, the [[Nether Highway Group|World Border teams]] made extensive use of pigs and pig spawners. Because you could fit in the 1x2 space of the tunnels while riding a pig, the pigs could be used with entity speed to immensely improve travel times through the 3.75 million block long tunnels. Hundreds if not thousands of Pig Spawners are placed at regular intervals millions of blocks deep into the nether, and most of them will likely remain unloaded for some time. If there is ever a time that the plugin that bans spawners is disabled, these would not be effected if their chunks were loaded. 

Also, many players keep Shulkerboxes of pig spawners inside their enderchest and dupe stashes. Because the plugin cannot check until a chest is opened, those stacks of pig spawners remain safe in a sort of limbo state inside those shulkers, waiting for a time when the plugin fails or is removed and those items can exist in the world again. &lt;gallery&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1731">Player Heads were rare artifacts that were the heads of select 2b2t players.

== History ==
The Player Heads were originally created when [[the Tyranny]] hacked into [[Hause Master|Hausemaster]]'s OP [[Georgebush420|alt]], allowing them to do whatever they wanted. One of the things they did was spawn in the heads of many players. While it is unknown the original amount of heads spawned, the number drastically rose during the [[11/11 Dupe]].

== Possession ==
Player Heads were usually sold by merchants for either real money or in game items (this option was usually difficult due to Gapples no longer being wanted by many on the mass market, but other items were commonly used instead).

Player heads were removed by Hausemaster at the same time as a bunch of other &quot;illegal&quot; items such as pig spawners, stacked armor, and enchanted glass, even though unlike all the other things he removed they didn't affect gameplay at all and were just rare, purely decorative items that formed a part of 2b2t's history. Hausemaster faced a lot of backlash over this decision, but player heads remain unobtainable.

== Mob Heads ==
For a long time, mob heads were unable to be obtained legitimately, due to Charged Creepers being unable to exist because of lightning being disabled. However, players still used backdoors, exploits and dupes to obtain them anyway. When lightning was re-enabled, it became possible once again to obtain mob heads legitimately.

== List of heads ==

* [[CytotoxicTcell]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1752">Plugin Town was a base that was made in the very early times of 2b2t and was known for how it was built. The base was built by [[popbob]], [[xcc2]], and several others using creative mode, which popbob granted to them with his [[Backdoors|backdoor]]. {{2B2T_Build_Template|title1 = Plugin Town|image1 = Plugin Town.png|type = Town|status = Destroyed|approx_date_construction_began = Sometime in 2011|approx_date_finished = Sometime in 2011|coordinates = ???|approx_date_demolished = Was destroyed over time (no massive grief)|demolishers = Common raiders, explorers, and looters|players_who_live(d)_here = popbob, xcc2, several others|builder(s) = popbob, xcc2, several others}}

== Architecture ==
The base was filled with riches, with gold, iron and diamond blocks being used as decoration and even foundation for particular buildings. Since the base was made during the Beta days of minecraft, the builders were restricted to using the comparatively few blocks available at the time, so they did their best to make the base look nice.

== Griefing ==
The base was eventually abandoned when [[Hausemaster|House_Master]] sniffed some coke and removed the creative mode access of the builders. It was left to the tides of anarchy and was eventually griefed by several raiders and people who stumbled upon the base, looting and destroying all the riches.

'''Downfall''':

Point Dory fell due to drama with basemate xxq. After multiple attempts of him destroying parts of the Hall of Heroes, xxq ran off on his own. When he was eventually questioned about why he left, he blamed his various basemates for harassing him. After weeks of uncertainty, xxq caved in all that he knew and it was revealed that his account NTTWestJPN was an alt shared with jared2013. MiningMinecraft also discovered that his copy, the only copy of Mein Kampf 121 and iTristan's 32k leggings were missing. xxq decided to share coordinates of jared2013's base. MiningMinecraft and Joeilk proceeded to raid the base in the dead of night and steal back Mein Kampf 121. Tristan's 32k leggings were recovered from one of xxq's shulkers and the group gathered to decide on xxq's fate. After days of deliberation, it was decided by Byrnsy that xxq would be kicked from the group and base. Days later, the coords to the base were then publicly leaked by xxq and Point Dory was griefed days later by Babbaj and Nordic93. A battle during the griefing ensued where Joeilk and MiningMinecraft killed Babbaj, sending him to spawn but Nordic93 managed to escape the defenders and combat logged. The base was then destroyed later that day once the defenders logged off.

Z: 0}}Point Nemo is a base that is placed on the 2b2t World Border, where it's cut by the +X axis. 

== History ==
The landscape of the area was generated in 1.6. The first known people, who reached the area, were [[Pyrobyte]] and [[iTristan]] in December 7th 2013 (most likely with a backdoor). They left a bedrock platform in the other side of the border, with two signs, reading:

''&quot;It's the end of the world -Pyrobyte   December 7 2013&quot;''

''&quot;iTristan was here. If you see this, shit went down&quot;''

iTristan also left the 121 book from the Mein Kampf collection, created by Victormeriqui and a super weapon on the other side of the border.  

In December 9th 2016, [[Byrnsy]] started a journey towards the very same place, thus formed the [[ +X Digging Group]]. It was established, that once they reach the World Border, they going to build a base there, just like they did at other notable points. They named it Point Nemo, after the oceanic pole of inaccessibility - the furthest point on Earth from land, located in the Southern Pacific Ocean.
[[File:Pointnemo.png|thumb|220x220px|Location of Point Nemo in real life]]
In March 26th 2017, the first group of diggers - [[househousehouse1]], [[xxq]], [[irql]], [[rasqi]], [[miningminecraft]], and several others - reached the World Border, and discovered Pyro's and iTristan's signs. They manged to get the Mein Kampf book.

As other group members also arrived, the building of the base started. In March 28th, when Byrnsy finished his journey, the place already started to take shape. However, it got griefed a day after.

In April 24th [[Fit]] finished his own journey, and several of the former diggers, including Byrnsy gathered at the partly repaired base for his greeting. 

In April 30th the base was griefed again.

During May, the base was destroyed, and lavacasted beyond repair.

The most popular places he based at were Passie Town, Plugin Town, and 2k2k. Policemike55 was also a notable member of the Facepunch Republic. Having a deep history on the server and being very well known among other players, he is friends and contains relatively close connections with other oldfags. He is also one of the few players to have a hold of rare and hacked items from various backdoors. To this day, policemike55 is one of the most active oldfags that still plays on the server.

Popbob is the most infamous [[Autistism|autist]] and griefer in 2b2t history. He is known for being both one of the oldest active players on 2b2t and the most iconic one. He's notorious for having griefed more bases than any other known player on the server.
== Early Times ==
Popbob is presumed to have joined 2b2t in very early 2011, although he became more active a few months later. The most famous base Popbob was a part of was [[Passie Town]], also known as Squid Base. He teamed with [[policemike55]], passie05, [[xcc2]], chase101, and CreamOfTheSlop (who turned out to be a traitor) and helped with the construction. He built a glass dome there, and he would later build more glass domes at other bases he lived in, including Plugin Town and another solo base. However, he could not finish the glass dome at Plugin Town because he couldn't make the edges come together. He also dug plenty of holes all the way down to bedrock for no particular reason.
He was consistently hateful in the main chat and ridiculed everyone constantly. In personal chats with other players he acted somewhat friendly, or at least not completely toxic. While he was being friendly (in comparison), though, he would be logging on with alts, lavacasting and blowing things up, or stealing information from other people's PCs. In later years he was more quiet, just spamming with Welcomer and Announcer. He may have been taking different medications over the years, creating different versions of popbob.

Popbob was able to do many things other players could not do because of his [[backdoors|backdoor]] access to 2b2t. This allowed him to do things like spawn in materials and even make a [[Pig Spawners|pig spawner]].

Popbob was also apart of early [[Facepunch Republic|Facepunch]] bases in 2011. One of the most well known was the &quot;1095 365&quot; base. The members were popbob, Tark, Dachande, stewe231, and Phagocytic.

After he left Passie Town, popbob moved on to become somewhat of a loner for a while and an independent player as he would continue to play with his FP friends and many others but would never stay with a group for long. He made some smaller bases with his previous basemates as well, such as 700base in 2013 with xcc2 and other facepunchers. He shared his backdoor abilities with other players, and they built [[Plugin Town]]. However, popbob continued to grief and was still a very dangerous person. Over the years, popbob, [[iTristan]] and other members of [[The Tyranny]] created their own client, nhack, to support his base finding and exploits.


== Griefing and Autismal Outbursts ==

Popbob went on to become an infamous griefer and autist. He worked as a lone wolf mostly in his griefing outbreaks and occasionally griefed with other facepunchers during the facepunch times of 2b and with D4RKJ0E ([[Jared2013|Jared]]) or [[iTristan]] during the [[Pre-Hype Period|Age of Tyranny]]. He was able to know exactly where players were at using the thunderbolt exploit. The exploit used an oversight in Minecraft's code that allowed the coordinates of thunder to be tracked down through packets, as the sound of thunder was global and would only strike where players were located. The exploit would send the coordinates to popbob in chat. This allowed Popbob to find players, kill them, and grief their bases.

Another infamous thing popbob did was steal information from other players. When many players including xcc2, taylo112, iTristan, and others were rebuilding a base known as Kaamtown, popbob used nhack to screenshot Omaliymix and Kaameron's desktop and send it to him. They both quit 2b2t after that, and xcc2 stopped using nhack. However, iTristan and ImperatorTerrae as well as some others continued to use it.

However during the third incursion, Popbob's griefing reign finally ended when the [[The Third Incursion|third]] [[Spawn Incursions|Incursion]] members hunted Popbob down and caused him to combat log. After this, popbob has left and rejoined many times on alt accounts or his main, spamming chat like a 5 year old to indicate that he's back in the game. Popbob uses alt accounts to keep his identity secret from the wave of new players, as the majority of them do not know the existence of these. Many people believe popbob quit 2b2t because of what Fit said, but he joins 2b2t occasionally on alternate accounts. Popbob was seen on December 4th, 2016, and some time in 2016 he re-connected a link in a chain of beds using the bed teleportation exploit on an alternate account known as RadicalHiccup so that Jared could use it to grief a base known as the Lands, a base owned by Jacktherippa. The last time he was seen for a long while was on April 1st, 2017, on the [[April Fools Maps|April Fools Map.]] The reason for his unexplained absence was that he was interested in playing other games, such as Football Manager 2016. &quot; (although this highly is questionable).

 &lt;/gallery&gt;

== Trivia ==
* popbob was amongst the first players to use hacks on 2b2t. Hacks at the time were not as readily available to the public as they are now. People would either code the early &quot;hacked clients&quot; themselves, or would get them from friends, or sketchy sites (as if they still are not sketchy today). Due to the fact that this was in early Minecraft, these may have been the first hacks ever used on Minecraft.
* It was said that popbob's sword swing was so fast, that you could not see his arm.
* According to [[Fit]], it was a considered by many to be a rite of passage if you were killed and griefed by Popbob and continued to play on the server.
* Despite his destructive tendencies, popbob seemed to enjoy building as well. Popbob's most known build is his trademarked [[Popbob's dome|glass dome]], although many new players seem to associate every glass dome with popbob.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3463">== Portals ==

There are three types of portal block in Minecraft. The most common of these is the Nether Portal block and the other two are the End Portal and End Gateway.

== Function ==
[[File:NetherPortal.gif|thumb|110x110px|A Nether Portal block]]

=== Nether Portal ===
If the player stands in a Nether Portal block for four seconds (More if [[TPS]] is low) they will be transported into the [[The Nether|Nether]] dimension (or into the [[The Overworld|Overworld]] if the portal is in the nether). These are incredibly common as they are made of obsidian, a highly durable but abundant block. This makes nether portals easy to build but time consuming to destroy. Many nether portals can be found within spawn and one is almost always active at 0,0. The Nether is a very useful dimension to have access to because of travel. moving one block in the nether is equivalent to moving eight in the Overworld, so a player can travel from one location in the overworld eight times faster if they do it through the nether. It is worth noting that if another active portal is detected within 128 blocks of the new one, they will link together and a new portal will not be created.
[[File:End Portal.png|thumb|150x150px|An End Portal block]]

=== End Portal ===
End Portals, as the name implies, allow travel between the overworld and the [[The End|End]]. End portals have troubled history on 2b2t. When they were first generated, only three were available, and these were quickly destroyed (back then portal blocks could be destroyed by explosions). Players then used hacks and backdoors to create their own, and [[Hausemaster|Hause]] continually destroyed these and tried to build one definitive portal structure for everyone to use. He enabled and disabled the entire dimension of [[The End]] many times. Between 2014 and the end of [[The Rusher War]] only two portals were known to the public (or rather the privileged public) and very few players actually built there. (With the exception of [[Torogadude]], [[Jacktherippa]], and [[Fit]]). Because of 1.9 and subsequent updates, and the work of Hause, There are many more permanent portals, and many players have access to and use the End, as it is a resource-rich and seemingly safe area, and little explored compared to the other dimensions.

=== End Gateway ===
The end gateway shares the texture of an end portal but is on all sides. It is used to teleport to the outer end islands, away from the main island. Relatively useless on 2b2t considering how easy it is to just build out, take a bridge someone else built, or use the Elytra+ hack. They are always surrounded by bedrock and require an enderpearl to enter.
[[File:End Gateway.png|thumb|125x125px|An End Gateway Block]]

== Trivia ==
* The End Gateway is the block used in the new 2b2t queue which gives the quasar-like background.
* None of these blocks are restricted by the &quot;disable block&quot; command and can be placed and stored easily.
* Each of these blocks except the nether portal block is indestructible and cannot be broken (Unless you are an admin or use an exploit)
* An end portal block was going to be installed at [[Aureus |Aureus]] but they didn't have time before the coords were leaked.
* The only way to obtain any of the item forms of these blocks is through commands. (Lets just thank the [[Melons|melon]] god that [[iTristan]] existed)

'''[[Timeline|Timeline of 2b2t]]'''

&lt;--- [[Age of Hype]]

---&gt; [[Unification Period]]

{{Infobox:_History|title1 = Grand Retard Period|date = January 2017 - September 2017|length = 9 months|player_rate = 80-250}}
The Grand Retard Period, also referred to as the Post-Hype Period or Grand Deceleration Period by some players was a period on 2b2t. It started with 2017, and the slow decline of activity on the server after the drastic effects of the [[The Rusher War|Rusher War]] and the [[Age of Hype]]. It is named such for the amount of retarded memes and autistic shitposting in the era. 

== The &quot;Disbandment&quot; of The Vortex Coalition ==
In January of 2017, [http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/The_Vortex_Coalition The Vortex Coalition] started getting banned unfairly by the mods in the /r/2b2t [[Subreddit]], who were using rule 4 as an excuse to remove any Vortex Coalition related post. This caused some controversy, however many were glad to see the subreddit cleared of VoCo members.

[http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/Coltsnid Coltsnid] decided that since VoCo had lost the 2b2t subreddit as a meme platform, he needed to push the memes to the next level. He began to call himself a god, and VoCo members that accepted him as their Lord and savior were accepted into his group of disciples. While many thought this was funny, some were not happy with this change of pace, and this caused controversy within the group. Some members who outright denounced Coltsnid were banned.

Around this time, one of the group's executives, [[HermeticLock]], who was responsible for running the website, decided to change the home page to a meme displaying the [[Don Fuer]] logo, which further escalated the tensions within the group, despite it mostly being a joke. On January 13th, 2017, this controversy drove executive member Sengorn_Leopard to the point of banning all users from the discord. When Coltsnid became aware of this, he deleted the discord server and posted an &quot;official&quot; disbandment on /r/2b2t. This post gained a lot of attention and once again the focus of /r/2b2t was The Vortex Coalition.

Before going inactive for the next several months, Coltsnid had a few more memes up his sleeve, such as &quot;VoCo II&quot; and &quot;selling&quot; the server to &quot;RockyEric&quot; and HermeticLock. VoCo operates in yearly phases, and Phase II was to go out with a meme-filled bang.

With VoCo being one of the largest groups on 2b2t, going inactive caused a significant power vacuum on the server, allowing several other groups to rise and fill the void the meantime. Some of these groups were created by former VoCo members, notably [[Singularity]] and the [http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/Spawn_Masons Spawnmasons].

== The Disbandment of The 4th Reich ==
In February of 2017, the members of the [[The 4th Reich|4th Reich]] leaked [[Tim_McNukepants]]' [[Duplication Glitches|dupe]] stashes and his belongings, calling and convincing the other members that Tim_McNukepants is a &quot;dumb, jewish sack of shit&quot;. This caused Tim to delete the 4th Reich discord, and the 4th Reich itself. The fall of the 4th Reich also marked the end of the Factions period of 2b2t.

== +X Highway Digging Group ==
The [[The Nether Highway Group|+x Nether dig group]] was a movement formed by [[Byrnsy]] in December of 2016, with the intents of finishing the Nether Highways. In February, the group became large, reaching over 15 members. This also sparked the popularity of the +X Highway.

=== Reaching the World Border ===
On 26 March, several members of the group reached the end of the +X Highway and finally reached X: +30,000,000. The signs left behind by [[pyrobyte]] and [[iTristan]] when they had been able to reach the world border through a backdoor were seen again for the first time in years.

== Hermeticlock's Spawn Base ==
[[Spawn Mark II|HermeticLock's Spawn Base]] is a simple spawn base created around 3,000 from spawn. He spread word of his spawn base to everyone, leading to a group of players joining him. A group of players also wanted to destroy the spawn base, leading to a huge war on February 9, 2017, possibly the 3rd Largest Battle in 2b2t History (or the [[Fitlantis]] battle, has more players).

== 2b2t Logo Rebranded ==
On February 23rd, 2017, the 2b2t logo was rebranded from the red and blue theme to a logo that resembles 2fast2furious, a 2003 American film and the second film of The Fast and Furious franchise. This was met with heavy criticism on the [[subreddit]], leading to [[Hausemaster]] claiming that the server was always named after 2fast2furious.

== Kinorana Map Crisis ==
A few days after the 2b2t logo being rebranded, all the [[Map Art|maps]] were hacked by 2b2t trader [[Kinorana]]. It was supposedly a prank, giving Hause a heads up before attempting the exploit. This was met with heavy hate from the community, causing massive riots in chat in the form of [[deathspamming]] words such as &quot;KINO IS A RETARD&quot;, &quot;HAUSE PEICE OF A SHIT FIX MAPS&quot;, &quot;FIX MAPS HAUSE&quot;, &quot;SEND KINO TO ISIS&quot;. Eventually, Kino reset all maps, however the old maps cannot come back and Hause refused to load the backup map files.

== Donkey Dupe ==
The Donkey Dupe was a duplication exploit found in March 2017 that was even larger than the 11/11 Dupe. It is a simple dupe exploit involving breeding donkeys and teleporting them to the Nether. It remains one of the largest dupes in 2b2t History. It only lasted for three days but was the most overpowered dupe.[[Donkey dupe memes| It was also the most memed dupe.]]

== The fr1kin Machine Crisis ==
The [[The fr1kin Machine Crisis|fr1kin Machine Crisis]] was a crisis in 2b2t that would, according to [[Fit]], be able to crash the server. The server began experiencing enormous amounts of lag during late of March 2017, far worse even than the lagdrops during [[the Rusher War]]. It was theorised that [[fr1kin]] was using a superposition glitch to load massive amounts of chunks, causing the server memory to overflow. [[Torogadude]] later discovered the lag wasn't caused by chunks loading, but instead by the server dividing the player's position by 8 until it either crashed or restarted.

A video by Fit was uploaded entitled &quot;[https://youtube.com/watch?v=90pzA8sevog THE END OF 2B2T] ?&quot; where he explains the fr1kin crisis. This caused the [[Subreddit]] to be flooded with [http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/2b2t_Doomsday doomsday clock shitposts].

== April Fools 2017 ==
During 4/1/17, the regular 2b2t map was replaced temporarily with a new map that would later reset. In this Tempmap, mobs would drop valuable items when killed (such as totems of undying, spawn eggs, etc). The Tempmap also had a chat filter, changing a lot of words into &quot;Old English&quot; and some old school 2b2t memes like &quot;Spilled goddamn nutmeg all over me&quot;.

The world download of the April fools map can be downloaded [https://mega.nz/#!9CQgEZRA!jsc_5YYpqWNMl8CHYgOSiSniEwCeHVp-oJQ_nR8Q6K0 here]

== &quot;Apocalypse Exploit&quot; patched ==
On April the 9th, the [[The Apocalypse Exploit|Apocalypse Exploit]] was patched due to /kill being disabled. Because of this event, it calmed the titties of everyone.

== AAC Plug-in ==
On April 25th, 2017, [[Hausemaster]] decided to add a plugin that would enable elytras on the server. The plugin being AAC (or Autistic [[Anti Cheat|Anti-cheat]] to some). It's been reported that on that same day, over 90 people were kicked from the server, even to the ones that '''didn't''' hack.

=== Temporary Removal And Re-Add ===
Hause temporarily removed AAC, possibly due to complaints that were server wide about the large issues (however, knowing Hause, this has a low chance of being the case). NCP was re-instated for a short period until early May when Hause re-added AAC (possibly a new update) and drastically reduced the issues seen by players. While there is still hate, it has been relatively dying down over the months and players have generally accepted it currently.

== June 1st Rumors ==
The June 1st Rumors (mostly [[shitposts]]) were the tumors that plagued the [[subreddit]]. They speculated that there would be an apocalypse on 2b when [[TheCampingRusher]] rejoined, or some other big youtuber joined. Other rumors speculated that when [http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/AntVenom Antvenom] makes his video on anarchy servers, the amount of players joining won't be like when [[rusher]] joined. The people that thought that 2b wouldn't be flooded with players also told people to calm down.

== June 1st, 2017 ==
June 1st marked the first anniversary of [[the Rusher War]]. The subreddit and other forms of 2b2t media have been filled with memories, [[shitposts]], and memes. [[Rusher]], as many people were worried about, did not show his face on the server (as of yet) and hasn't made a single remark to 2b2t on June 1st.

== VoCo Phase III ==
On June 2nd, 2017, [http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/The_Vortex_Coalition The Vortex Coalition] reformed and began recruiting new members. With 2b2t falling into decline, activity in The Vortex Coalition will likely reach the levels it had during the Rusher Era. Despite this, their discord server is one of the most populated 2b2t related servers with over 140 members (purged of inactive members monthly).

Salamander, Joe(ovnel), Cyan, and [[househousehouse1]], remain as the executive members.

In Phase III, The Vortex Coalition built 5 separate group bases, two of which were major bases sprawling across thousands of blocks. One being a large above-ground city, another being a large underground cave housing a dwarven fortess. They have also renovated their 420/911 spawnbase for 2017, although it has already been griefed heavily.

== First Battle of Summer, 2017 ==
On June, 4th, 2017 the [[Spawn Masons]] encountered several [[Peacekeepers]] near spawn. The encounter started when the Peacekeepers managed to jump [[Torogadude]]. It eventually turned into a large fight when [[Fit]] and many more masons showed up to fight PK. The fight was interrupted by the server restarting.

Both sides claimed victory in this conflict, making it uncertain as to who won. The Peacekeepers say that since the Spawn Masons retreated that the victory was theirs, while the Spawn Masons main goal was to save Toro and once they did, they felt no need to risk a fight and waste gear.

== +Z Axis Highway Completed ==
On June 9th, 2017, the +Z Axis Highway was completed by the [[+Z Digging Group]] and reached Z: +30,000,000.

== 1.12 Update (Large Improvements to Server) ==
Normally, when 2b2t updates to the latest version of Minecraft, not much happens to the server other than regular maintenance and bug/exploit/glitch fixes and the regular [[Update Periods|update periods]]. However, a post on the 2b2t subreddit, posted on June 13th, 2017 by the 2builders2tools admin account, announced several new changes to the server, such as new chat plugins, new improvements to the queue system, and new server changes overall. According to the post, the 1.12 update would be postponed a couple weeks for 2b2t due to large changes.

Reddit Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t/comments/6h092r/2b2t_112_update_a_reminder_that_you_are_here/

== Return of Kinorana's 32K Weapons ==
On June 17th, 2017, [[Kinorana]] and a few members of the [[Spawn Masons]] headed to [[spawn]] and all had [[Super Weapons|32K weapons]]. It was rumored that most of these weapons were disabled by [[Hausemaster|Hause]], with a few escaping and being simply mythical. However, it appeared that Kino and his buddies were armed to the teeth with these deadly one shot weapons. The method in which they acquired these weapons is unknown. Fit and [[AlphaComputer]] made a video in which they went around spawn killing withers and airborne peacekeepers with a pair of 32K swords. Once the existence of these new 32k weapons went public, Hause removed overpowered enchantments once again, but since it apparently didn't work the first time, some of them may still exist or come into existence in the future.
==Server Crash Crisis==
Somewhere around 23rd of June 2017 an unknown player or group started lagging the server to an extreme degree. The server was constantly at 2 [[TPS]] or lower. After some time, the lag got so bad the server started to crash, to the point where the delay between the server restarting and crashing again was lesser than one minute, making it entirely unplayable. During these brief moments between restarting and crashing, lots of commotion was seen in chat, with it being the only function other than walking that a player could do. The restarts also caused a queue glitch, when if the player joined within the first 10 seconds after the restart, they would be stuck on position number 0 in the queue until they eater logged out or got disconnected.

The glitch was similar to the negative stack size glitch in Minecraft, the same one that allowed the existence of &quot;[[Hacked Items|infinites]]&quot;. The crisis ended when [[Hausemaster]] removed the lag machine(s) that were causing it (it's not confirmed, but it's also the most likely of all the options). The crisis was likely caused by 2F4U leaking the exploit in PandaWire that allowed to create extreme lag very easily as well as the way to permanently load chunks without connecting them to the world spawn being discovered by a YouTuber called [https://youtube.com/channel/UCRtyLX-ej-H1PSiaw8g9aIA gnembon_mc] .

The players and groups that were suspected of causing the crisis are:
*[[VoCo]] (resurrected shortly before the crisis; known for being lagfags).
*[[Spawn Masons]]
*[[Armorsmith]]
*[[The Emperium|Emperium]]
*[[Team Coca Cola]]
*[[Fit]]
*[[househousehouse1]] 
*Just a bunch of randoms who abused the PandaWire exploit at the same time.

== Return of The World's Famous Spawn Base ==
On June, 29th, 2017, [[HermeticLock]] announced the &quot;second season&quot; of hanging around at his [[World Famous Spawn Base|spawnbase]].

== 2nd Server Crash Crisis ==
[[File:2nr52MD.png|thumb|220x220px]]
During the 6th of July, 2017 an event similar to the first Server Crash Crisis happened when the TPS was lowered to less than 1 (In fact, it reached all the way down to 0.35). This lag made 2b2t unplayable, and the server was crashed at least 3 times. During that day, the server player rate was lowered drastically, and at some point, only 20 players were online at the same time. Chat was spammed constantly and the lag lasted for the whole day, to the point of where even the chat was laggy and glitchy. Many people believe that the intense lag was caused by artisitc [[lagfags|lagppls]] such as [[Armorsmith]] and/or [[VoCo]], and that [[Hausemaster]] failed to remove all of the [[Lag Machines]] from the previous Server Crash Crisis. After the final crashes and resets, [[Hausemaster]] closed the server down for maintenance for a whole day. He did this to prepare the server for the upcoming 1.12 update and also for fixing the problems that were made during this day. Hause later stated on a reddit post that he will fix the Lag Machine issue on later updates.

== Other Crashes and Lag Issues, Lag Era? ==
Since the Second Crash Crisis, the server has seen even more events of pure lag that caused the server to

be unplayable and sometimes even crash. Player rate was also very low and sometimes reached to only 15 players online a time. Many Reddit threads were called to ban the autist [[lagfags]] who make this lag. Many have started to give up on this topic, nothing was done against the issue when the server was down for maintenance. It's unclear who causes the lag, most of the people believed it was either [[househousehouse1]] or [[Armorsmith]], but it's clear that whoever causes that lag, he harms the server badly. Because of autist lagfags, the server population might decrease even more. There's nothing a regular player can do but to hope that Lag Machines will be fixed when the 1.12 update comes out. Server population decreased to 13 players online a time. That's an even worse statistic than the 2nd Server Crash Crisis.

Armorsmith announced on a reddit post that his Lag Machine is strong enough to lower the TPS down to a point of where the server will crash. He said in his post that he will use an MC Leaks Alt to stand near the so called &quot;Carolina Lag Machine&quot;, causing it to work constantly and lag the server all the time. Many people believe it's not true, although at the past he already proved his abilities. Besides Armorsmith, many lagfags such as members of [[The Vortex Coalition]] and househousehouse1 have also claimed to have the ability to crash the server. Many people hope that HauseMaster will fix the issue at some point. The server was seeing less players in the days leading up to the 1.12 Temporary Map.

The TPS reached 0.25 and only 3 &quot;Normal&quot; players were online and 2 autist lagfags.

== 1.12 Temporary Map ==
As a means to test out new plugins on the server, Hausemaster created a [[Temp Maps|temporary map]] on July 8th, 2017 that lasted a week, in preparation of the server's update to 1.12. The map was limited to a 8000x8000 area with no strongholds and higher than usual ore spawning rates. For the first two days it was constantly thunderstorming. Many groups were competing to be the &quot;top dog&quot; on the map. On July 22nd the server returned to the original old map.

== Disbandment of the Spawn Masons ==
[[Hermeticlock]] announced on reddit that the [[Spawn Masons]] were disbanded. This decision followed several months of infighting and many players leaving, both due to [[Fit]]'s griefing of [[Summermelon]], and due to waning interest in spawnmason activites.

== Back to NCP ==
The server's anticheat went back to NCP for the 234085430th time this year. Elytra has been disabled on most clients but Jesus now works as long as you use the type that bypasses NCP

== Battle of the Southern Canal ==
A medium battle occurred at [[the Southern Canal]] on August 19th, 2017. After a major grief on the Canal by [[Househousehouse1|HouseHouseHouse1]], MiningMinecraft and his friends, TheresaMay, Aurumion, Hammernaut, and TwinkleTard, D3R6 headed out to repair some of the damage. Eventually, the group were ambushed by [[Jared2013]], TheColdOneJC, Salamander27, and SmashAxe. The battle resulted with Jared2013 and Salamander being killed, TheColdOne and Hammernaut logging, and SmashAxe, D3R6, and TwinkleTard fleeing.

== Spanish Crisis ==
On September 15th, 2017, [[ElRichMC]], a Spanish Youtuber, made a youtube video on 2b2t, with a title that translated to &quot;The Most Violent and Old Server in Minecraft&quot; (pretty much still following the clickbait title that [[TheCampingRusher|Rusher]] made long ago). This brought a small influx of Spanish speaking people to the server (Roughly 100-200 people based on the queue). This event caused some uproar around the community with some people thinking this might turn into a major crisis and instigate another war, and with others thinking it'd fizzle down like the similar French Crisis. It was just another moment of waiting and seeing. In the end, it was apparent that no new major influx of players would occur, and life on 2b2t would continue as it had.

According to ElRichMC, he stated on reddit that he would continue his series if he reached a certain amount of likes and views (250,000 views). This goal was passed, but no new videos (relating to 2b2t) are present on ElRichMC's channel.

=== Trivia ===

In the description of ElRich's video its states &quot;A SERVER OF 7 YEARS... What could possibly go wrong?&quot;, as if he may have known about previous invasions.
[[File:3vpaTG729-E2twunGBUABhDC9cDI7bCotyk2fw5fjTc.png|thumb|327x327px|The player influx during the spanish crisis, compared to the Rusher War]]
ElRichMC states that &quot;Every pro knows that 2 apples can get you anywhere&quot; for the reason why he was sprinting and jumping in his video. As anyone who has played 2b2t and has half a brain knows, 2 non-golden apples can hardly get you anywhere at all, especially when you're at spawn. This statement was heavily mocked on the 2b2t [[subreddit]] for obvious reasons.

'''[[Timeline|Timeline of 2b2t]]'''

&lt;--- [[Second Valkyrian Period]]

---&gt; [[Age of Hype]]

{{Infobox:_History|title1 = Pre-Hype Period|date = May 2015 - May 2016|length = 1 year|player_rate = 60-90}}
The Pre-Hype Era is a period of 2b2t that unlike most era's of 2b2t, is not focused on one large event. At the end of the 3rd Spawn Incursion (See [[Spawn Incursions]]), many players went on to settle in [[Aureus City]]. This Era was also known for a lot of destruction and the 2b2t third backdoor. People were able to utilize the /a exploit, allowing them to figure out players' coordinates which this left many bases like [[Space Valkyria|Space Valk]], [[King's Landing]], and [[Olympus]] to be destroyed. A group of players were also able to hack into an OP alt of [[Hause Master]] and were able to use it to give themselves stashes and super weapons. The era ended when [[TheCampingRusher]] joined the server.

== Info from Sato86 ==
The history continues however as big scandals would hit the server weeks later. First was the “/a exploit “that allowed players to triangulate people’s coords, causing the destruction of several bases and more recently the backdoor leak which was proved that illegal administrative acts took/was taken place between 2015 and 2016. The whole drama started by the leak and the admin refusal or blindness, caused a big chunk of the regulars to leave 2b2t.



Today it is well known that Tristan, Taylo, Jared, Clyde and others were involved in using a OP’ed account named georgebush420, which belonged to Hausemaster. They had stole its access and were using it to destroy anyone who they didn’t like and spam superweapons and stashes for themselves. This situation would leave the 2b2t playerbase vulnerable, as many good players quit the server due the abuse, for the scenario we have presently, the biggest invasion the server ever faced.



But this invasion might not have happen if so many articles were not written about the server during this period. Motherboard and RPS wrote articles before the youtube mayhem on 2b2t. This is now just speculation, but they might have made possible for Napkin to find 2b2t and that way, Rusher as well.



This period was also one of the most destructive. Major bases were destroyed such as King’s Landing, Space Valkyria, Olympus, and Imperators' base. The only redeeming event about 
this time was that Project Vault began during this period, as a initiative to preserve the server’s history and beauty, with the participation of dozens. Months dedicated to travel around 2b2t and recover as many world downloads of bases as possible. The tide of destruction was countered by the most noble act ever done on 2b2t.

== Trivia ==
* [[The Vortex Coalition]] was founded during this era.
* The last 2b2t thread on Facepunch was closed during this era, completely ending any relation between 2b2t and Facepunch.
* [[Project Vault]] was started near the end of this era.
* [[Backdoor Nation|The Backdoor Nation]] was founded during this era.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1206">PriorityQueue is a bot on 2b2t. It gives statistics on the 2b2t [[queue]] such as its current length and entry rate into the server, as well as the hourly average. It posses the following commands players can use:

!queue - Gives the current length of the 2b2t queue and the entry rate from the queue into the main server, as well as the hourly average for both.

!priority &lt;playername&gt; - Lists whether the player given has queue priority. The list of players it can do this for is far from complete and can only give statistics for players who have recently logged in.

!pos - Gives you PriorityQueue's coordinates. Note that this command is shared with [[Bible Bot|BibleBot]] so you will also recieve BibleBot's coordinates.

== Alleged Creative Mode ==
On March of 2017, a rumor spread around that PriorityQueue had creative mode. [[Torogadude]] went to Nether 0,0 and the rumors were real, and PriorityQueue was flying and not being able to be hit by anything. This is caused by a glitch in which PriorityQueue would be sent to the Nether by someone else and he would be invincible until a server reset occurs. However, he does not actually have Creative Mode.[[Category:Spambot]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4968">[[File:Maxresdefault (3).jpg|thumb|220x220px|Project Vault spawn]]Project Vault refers to an ongoing project on 2b2t with the objective of preserving the server's history. It was founded in August 2015 by the Vault Curator, a (formerly) anonymous player. The project involves the creation of a separate server from 2b2t, where players can visit old relics and monuments that existed (or still exist) on 2b2t, in their past ungreifed states. There will also be coordinates posted to them, so that players can visit them on the real 2b2t server, destroyed or not.

The project was worked on by over 15 other players, and the crew intends to eventually release the Vault to the public. Players can &quot;donate&quot; their base to Project Vault by saving a [[World Downloads|world download]] of it and giving the file to the ones in charge of Project Vault. The server hub is situated within a fully completed replica of the [[Spawn Incursions|Wrath Outpost]], filled with nether portals that will each teleport players to a desired base. The end hub is located within a fully completed replica of [[Space Valkyria]].

It features several famous builds on 2b2t, including [[Imp Base|Imps Base]], [[Asgard II]], [[Fitlantis]], [[Dark Souls Castle]], [[Space Valkyria]], [[King's Landing]], and many others. The server will also offer background on several bases, like who built them and why they were destroyed. It was planned to be released to the public in late May to early June of 2017, but this never happened, and it is unclear just when it will go public.

== The Vault Curator ==
[[File:Screenshot 2017-01-23 at 8.19.04 AM-0.png|thumb|220x220px|The Vault Curator]]
[[Fit]] tried to shroud the Vault Curator's true identity failed. Some speculated the Curator to be Spartan512 after a leak from some other video. This speculation was confirmed when CainesLaw accidently said Spartan's name when he logged on during FitMC's livestream of Project Vault when only the Curator and Fit were online at the time.

== The Hall of Heads ==
The Hall of Heads is a hall added to the Space Valkyria end hub of the server that contains the heads of many of 2b's most notable players. The hall is neutral and does not refrain from adding player heads of people who have been hated and have had conflict with others.

== Discrepancies ==
While it is intended to be open to the public, the ones behind the project have barely given any sort of information on progress for over a year. After the Rusher War, when the project got more popular and the demand for the server grew, Fit made two livestreams showing off bases. He has given players little information on the project's progress. He had said that the server would be opened during late May or early June of 2017, which of course never happened. The little information received from Fit's videos gives the indication that the crew is apparently working to make sure the server is completely &quot;hacker proof&quot;. Players were obviously disappointed about this, and so some people completely gave up on the server ever opening to the public due to midfags being selfish and only allowing a select few enter the server. Even before this, players grew suspicious in the sincerity of the midfags in charge wanting to make the server public.

Several players decided to start their own take on Project Vault. Several people server wide began to trade and donate world downloads of 2b2t's greatest builds, and players began to create several small projects to gather downloads, (i.e. Project Timelock). Eventually, in early June of 2017, one of the smaller projects beat Project Vault in its release to the public, known as [[The Museum]]. [[The Museum]], created by The_Director2b2t, currently has a large amount of bases, created not only by oldfags and midfags, but by newfags as well, which is perceived as making the Museum non discriminatory against any specific player. With this in mind, many players began to complain about the server, starting a rumor that the server was an IP grabber. [[Fit]] also believed this and relayed this information in one of his videos, making many fitfags fear the server, and making other players begin to believe that [[Fit]] waas jealous of the new server that beat Vault at becoming public.

This rumor died down due to several oldfags and midfags not being sore losers, such as [[James_Rustles]], who commented on [[BarrenDome]]'s video about the museum and said that he wished him the best, Offtopia on reddit telling people that the server was not an IP grabber, the people in charge of the Museum telling people it is a myth, and just a lot of the 2b2t community not believing Fit.

== Trivia ==
* [[Fit]] has gone onto Project Vault for base tours as he has no chance of being attacked by anyone. Hence why, in his videos, the bases are in prime condition, despite some of them being destroyed on the actual server.

Crapville was a small town with a partially-working autofarm and at least 5 residents.

In Mid-June, 2018, Athena413 burned a few structures, but the base was likely abandoned long before.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1147">Purgatory is a base on 2b2t.org. It was founded on May 28th, 2018, and greifed by [[Lifeisgood72]] on 6/1/2018.

== History ==
During the planning of the upcoming base, Builders Haven, one of the base members, 1Charlie3, (now a Base Overseer) suggested to Beardler and Jonathan5454 to create a base near the planned coords. 1Charlie3 set up the temp base 50k blocks away from the coords. Purgatory slowly grew into a partial underground base. Purgatory had underground roads to connect other parts of the base, such as a Villager farm and a dupe stash (credit to GlowskiBroski).

== Downfall ==
During the short lifespan of the base, Beardler invited Lifeisgood72 without discussing the invitation with Jonathan5454. Beardler also gave account information to Lifeisgood72, which allowed him to get coords to builders haven (note: builders haven would bw ruined by loading up the planned chunks, as builders haven is a planned 1.13 base).

== History ==
After the grief of [[Purgatory]], the members of Builders Haven set up a temp base near the Z+ highway to build until the release of 1.13. Purgatory was slowly constructed over 16 days. Before the grief, Purgatory was larger than several main bases on 2b2t. It boasted checkers tournaments, spleef games, an upcoming olympics, map art, and the beginnings of its own resource pack.

There was no plan to the base; instead, the base is an explosion of styles and ideas, a testament to the imaginative power of many builders in a short time frame.

== Downfall ==
Purgatory and Purgatory 2, were managed by the project overseers Jonathan5454 and Beardler, as temp bases for the members of Builders Haven.

Within the month of June, Beardler became infamous after griefing Bodecken and Block Game Mecca, alongside leaking [[Jared2013]]s ip and (accidentally) leaked several unfinished bases that were on the [[The Museum]]. To obtain revenge on Beardler, members at [[BGM (Block Game Mecca)]] (note: Xdolf was not part of Block Game Mecca) obtained coords to Purgatory 2 and griefed the base.

The effects of the grief of Purgatory 2 was severe. After the grief, the 2b2t subreddit exploding with &quot;BEARDLER BASE GRIEFED&quot; posts, which slowly died down after 48 hours. In order to make up Beardlers absence, Jonathan5454 promoted Bloctagon, 1Charlie3, and Hawkedonfonix to project overseers. Beardler claims that he is ''quitting ''2b2t, however it has been noted that Beardler has been threatening the members of Builders Haven to re-invite him as &quot;he has more authority over them&quot;. Purgatory 3 (meme base at 0 0) and Purgatory 4 was founded after the grief of Purgatory 2. 25 out of the 53 members of Builders Haven were kicked for inactivity around the grief of Purgatory 2.

===Outskirts===

====ValleyOfWheat Memorial====

One of the first few builds started in Purgatory 2 was the ValleyOfWheat Memorial or the VOWm. I being the creator (xX_Regicide_Xx) and designer decided to go for the classic 2b2t VOW temple for symbolizing the valley. I decided on creati ng this for memories of the valley even though it has had a dark past. I wanted to save a part of history that I have saved countless times at the true sight or at least took part in helping. The inside of the temple was to be a ring with a garden around it with a weekly spleef game under the garden. Annual competitions would be held to remember the valley as we played our games under it. This is why the ValleyOfWheat Memorial was created.





===The Underground/Quarry===

Pyrobyte is a player who joined sometime in early 2013 or late 2012. Pyrobyte would quickly team up with [[Sato86|Sato]] and Drewbookman to form the Black Flag Group. The Black Flag Group would later fuse with [[Hitlerwood]] and create [[Valkyria]], a project that became the name of the people building it. Pyrobyte would participate in the 3 [[Spawn Incursions|incursions]] before Valkyria disbanded. Pyrobyte is pretty infamous for the second backdoor where he and [[iTristan]] made a Bukkit plugin to spawn in hacked items like the infamous 32K weapons, as well as being the first along with [[iTristan]] to make it to the world border (via teleportation). His reign of backdoor access lasted until early 2016. {{2B2T_Player_Template|title1 = Pyrobyte|approx_join_date = 2012-2013|reddit_username = Pyrobyte|past_affiliation(s) = Valkyria, Backdoor Crew}}

== Trivia ==
* [https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t/comments/4euvlx/the_kings_of_2b2t/ He was the first player to name withers with the title &quot;Pyrobyte is the king of 2b2t&quot;.]
* Has extensive knowledge of java.
* One of the few real hackers on the server
* [[Fit|FitMC]] called him the true king of 2b2t because he had backdoor access but had the restraint to not use it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7116">The queue is a proxy server used to connect to the main 2b2t server. It serves as a queuing system for players wishing to join 2b2t. The queue was initially created during the [[Age of Hype]] to manage the enormous flood of players brought on by the arrival of [[TheCampingRusher]] and the subsequent [[The Rusher War|Rusher War]].

== History ==
[[File:401px-2b2t-serverWaitlist-0.png|thumb|220x220px|Original Queue]]
On June 1st, 2016, a popular minecraft youtuber known as TheCampingRusher uploaded his first 2b2t video. This caused a massive rush to the server as hundreds of his fans attempted to join at once. This wave prompted [[Hause Master|Hause]] to implement a queue system to keep the server systems afloat. This queue required the player to continously reconnect every few seconds, thus encouraging the use of hacked clients with AutoReconnect. Rusher then offered to buy 2b2t from Hause. Hause declined and Rusher suggested a new queue system. Within this system, all players that joined prior to June 1st, 2016 were given priority over the newer players. This would enable them to join in minutes rather than hours. A paid priority system was also added where a player could buy priority for $20 per month. The money raised would go towards maintaining the server costs. This and the basic queue is the system that is still used to this day.

During the early days of this new queue, players could be kicked for afk and were forced to stay on their computer and to check every once in a while in order not to get kicked. This has been fixed in later updates and restarts from the server.[[File:Bg7fthsmsqbx.png|thumb|218x218px|Second queue system put into place. Was updated in December of 2017. ]]
== System ==

=== Three Types of Queue ===
There are three types of Queue Membership.
* Basic Queue - This is the queue that all players are given unless the pay for priority.
* Pre-Rusher Queue - This is given to all players that joined before June 1st, 2016. This queue was removed on December 4, 2017 because it was no longer relevant since it had been so long since the Rusher War.
* Paid Queue - This is given to any player that paid $20 for a month access.
The Paid Queue has the highest levels of priority, they have reserved slots which allows them to enter the main server easily.

The Veteran Queue was a system requested by the [[Team Veteran|Veterans]] during the height of the Rusher War. It was standard non-reserved queue, but they were ahead of all the Basic Queue members. This was queue system was deleted on December 4, 2017 along with other queue updates.

The Basic Queue is the lowest level of priority, it is also the largest. When the Veteran Queue still exsited, the position for Basic Queue players would increase due to the higher queue levels' reserved slots.

=== The Queue Server ===
The Queue is situated on a server of [[The Archon]]. It is an empty end dimension that puts the player in spectator mode. [[File:Howqueueworks.png|centre|thumb|471x471px|A visual representation of how the priority system works. Black = Basic, Red = Veteran, Yellow = Paid
]]

== Controversy ==
The queue is a very controversial subject on 2b2t for a variety of reasons. One of the major reasons is that Rusher uses the queue as a way of milking the server for money. Rusher has shown that he can add or remove anyone from the veteran queue list, which he did with [[Torogadude]]. This action was later reversed and Rusher promised never to do this again. Rusher denies that he created the priority queue system just for money as many people had emailed Hausemaster beforehand, asking if they could buy queue priority.

The queue can be a few hours long at peak hours, effectively rendering 2b2t a pay-to-play server for new players. This also spawns a lot of hate for 2b2t youtubers such as [[Fit|FitMC]], who bring their subscribers to the server and increase the queue times for regular players. Some even say that Fit actually has a deal with Rusher where he brings his fans to the server in order to increase the number of people buying priority queue, however this is little more than speculation.

The existence of reserved slots for paid priority players is a controversial topic as this means a queue can exist even when the server isn't completely full. This raises questions that the queue actually has little to do with lag prevention as the server could easily accomadate more players.

In a video by Toro, he has talked about why the queue will most likely never be removed. His reasoning is essentially the most basic business reason, supply and demand. Hause is continuing to use the queue to make enough money to spend on the server. It's paying his bill and so would lead to why he will continue to keep it. It only takes 13 donators to pay off the $250 fees, 5 to pay for the general payment of $90, that are required to pay off for the server each month. It is unknown how much money is given to Rusher from this and Toro criticized in the video that Rusher never talked about the fate of the money he gains from the server since his drama video about #FreeToro and the queue itself.

== Queue Size ==
This is a new, ongoing graph set up by Jonathan5454, that will track how long the queue is. This is for testing purposes of the community and to see how the queue expands/shrinks due to events. Anyone may participate, please put down the exact time of when you joined, and what timezone you are in.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1115">Queue Clogger Bots are bots, some of which were made during the [[The Rusher War|Rusher War]], with two purposes: greet players and clog up the [[Queue |queue]]. There were several made during the Rusher War and beyond, and others made earlier that were later repurposed. They are very tedious and can stay online for days. Keep in mind that some of these bots are actually main accounts of certain players and can be used as bots. The bots use the Aristois Chatspammer.

Queue clogging bots made a reappearance following [https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t/comments/75y9sy/upcoming_changes_website_queue_to_be_reworked_and/ Hausemaster's announcement]  that the pre-June priority queue would be removed, most likely as a protest to the change. This led to the queue often being at over 100 players even during non-peak hours, making it very difficult to access the server without some form of priority access.

Ragnarok was a base built by [[0xymoron]], Ace_Of_SpADeZ, and others. The base was home to one of the largest 2b2t museums and had several artifacts and riches.{{2B2T_Building_Template|title1 = Ragnarok I|image1 = UxDm7Eg.jpg|type = Town|status = Blown to smitherenies|builders = 0xymoron, Ace_Of_SpADeZ, Roadhog360, pYr01v1aniac, policemike55, Jared2013, _Aaron_, Nacloste, 086|leaked_by = Jared2013|approx_date_destroyed = December 26th, 2016|destroyed_by = 4th Reich|realm = Overworld|coordinates = Unknown|caption1 = Town Center|players_who_live(d)_here = Doctrzombie and all builders|approx_date_construction_began = September 10th, 2016|approx_date_finished = Sometime in November 2016|approx_date_leaked = December 26th, 2016}}

== History ==
The base was started on September 10th, 2016 by 0xymoron and Ace_Of_SpADeZ. The base was originally a small wheat farm but as the two continued to build the base, they eventually invited more players.

The base eventually began to be personalized by the individuals who lived there and eventually, 0xymoron came up with the idea to create a museum.

The museum contained several map arts, regular maps of some bases, artifacts and even a dragon egg from [[Imp Base]].

Eventually, [[Jared2013]] betrayed his friends (as he always does), left the base and leaked the base coordinates to [[Tim_McNukepants]] . [[The Fourth Reich]] soon showed up to wreck the place and when 0xymoron returned from an Elytra flight, he found most of the base completely destroyed. The destruction of the base was shown live by the 4th Reich as they sought revenge against 0xymoron for previously leaking their base.

During the attack, several members grabbed what they could from the museum and stashes and fled.

The original group now plans to create a second Ragnarok with what they had from the original base.

== Architecture ==
The base had several personalized structures such as a Mushroom Cloud, Mushroom Tower, a large wizard tower and the museum. The base was littered with statues all around the base. The base also featured a facepunch and plugin town memorial.

== History ==
Ravendel was founded in November 2011 and slowly grew in population over time. Due to the map no longer having any limitations, players used the town as a place to rest while adventuring. The town was eventually griefed by [[Popbob]] early 2012, causing the town to become abandoned.

== Architecture ==
Ravendel has many simple builds that were quite common in 2011. Ravendel boasts a large cobblestone tower. Ravendel also has a cobblestone wall used to keep hostile mobs out of the town, as they were quite common at the time. The town also had a town hall and a library. Ravendel also has a large cobblestone cube that was most likely used as a hostile mob grinder, as well as a 3 floor farm. There is also a hole used to spawn passive mobs for food, as mobs would spawn on lit grass blocks during the era. [[Offtopia]] also attempted to build house made of mushrooms, but failed.[[File:2016-12-11 17.43.08.png|thumb|234x234px]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2947">Rhadamantis, originally Kyriath, also known as the Lost City, is the last major base built before the second incursion in the summer of 2013. It gained the title of &quot;Lost City&quot; due to the fact that not many players know or have been to the base.{{2B2T_Build_Template|type = City|status = Partially destroyed (abandoned)|players_who_live(d)_here = SAINTEIRIK, Bigmerc, Bisquette, pheno778, pyrobyte, Sato86, Grahamcracker and others.|approx_date_construction_began = Summer of 2013|approx_date_finished = Summer of 2013|builder(s) = SAINTEIRIK, Bigmero, Bisquette, pheno778, and others.|approx_date_leaked = N/A|leaker = N/A|approx_date_demolished = N/A|demolishers = Random explorers and raiders|realm = Overworld|coordinates = ???|image1 = Temp_587d4ada421303.87132086}}[[File:Download (4).jpg|thumb|120x120px]]
== History ==
It was built by SAINTEIRIK, Lordloffar, Bigmero, Bisquette, pheno778, and others. Not much was known about this group except the fact that they were an independent group that existed in 2013. The base was then abandoned by the group for unknown reasons and was left to time. Eventually, people began to stumble upon the base and minor damage was dealt to the base. It was then found by [[pyrobyte]] and [[Sato86]] and was claimed for [[Valkyria]] . They fixed several buildings in the base and made the signature [[Eagles|Valkyrian Eagle]] on the main building. The two eventually left the base aswell and it was once again left to the tides of anarchy. Once again, people began stumbling upon the base and they either admired it or made minor damage but never settled. For the whole of the three years since it has been uninhabited, it surprisingly only experienced a relatively small amount of damage over the years, considering the build is on an anarchy server. It has not experienced a major grief and several buildings are relatively intact or completely untouched due to it being a very unknown base. Its mysteriousness was its best defence essentially and hopefully it won't be griefed because of [[Fit|Fit's]] video.

== Sign House ==
Near the town square, Rhadamantis hosts a small shack made of mainly oak wood with a brick top while spruce wood was used to repair the walls. It has two dandelions inside flower pots, one next to an oak tree. There is some fencing next to the house. Inside are many, many signs with no clear purpose or meaning. It is obvious that these signs are not original as some are on the spruce wood. Some include:
* HOW DO I MAKE BREAD? I'M SO HUNGRY TODAY.
* WILL YOU PLEASE GET ME A COW FOR CHRISTMAS?
* THE LION'S WORLD IS COLD, AND SHARP, AND FIERCE!
* PUNISH ME WITH BRUTALITY; MAKE ME FEEL LIKE A BIG BABY!
* DADDY, DADDY! WHAT IS HEAVEN LIKE?
* FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS UNTIL THE BEGIN TO REVERSE...
* WHY DO WE HAVE TO EAT POPCORN SANDWICHES TONIGHT?
* THAT MEANS YOU HAVE MENTAL STABILITY ISSUES. I DON'T DENY IT.
* NOW I HEAR THE LAUGHTER, FOREVER AND EVER...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3889">Note: Please be informed that this Era was too short to actually be included in the timeline, therefore does not appear on it. However, the Era is technically part of the Age of Hype and is still a valid term for this period of history. 

The Rusher Era (formerly the Camper Era early on in the Era), is a period of 2b2t history following the Consolidation Era. The Era revolved around the YouTuber known as [[TheCampingRusher]], with almost a million subscribers. The Rusher Era, despite popular belief, did not directly coincide with the length of [[The Rusher War]], which lasted from June 13th - October 9th, 2016 and was the major event of the era, but rather the time TheCampingRusher played on the server, June 1st - October 22nd, 2016. This was the most populated Era in all of 2b2t history, outnumbering the population from Facepunch, Reddit, 4chan, and IGN combined. 

The Rusher Era Began when [[TheCampingRusher]] posted a video about 2b2t on his youtube channel on June 1st, 2016. Due to Rusher being a popular youtuber, hundred of his fans flooded the server, causing the server to run like shit. In order to prevent the large amount of players from ruining the server, [[Hause Master]], the owner of 2b2t, implemented a queue system and made the tempmape. The tempmape was then removed and the server returned to the oldmape after House upgraded the server's hardware to run better. After a few weeks of the queue system being implemented, Rusher aided House in implementing an improved queue system with Veteran Queue (for the oldfags) and Priority Queue (which you could pay for). You were lucky if the server had below 1000 people waiting in queue for the server as the server usually had 1000-5000 players waiting in line at the height of the era.

Due to all of this happening, players who were dedicated to 2b2t were getting mad and formed [[Team Veteran]] to combat the Rushers.This led to the largest war in 2b2t history, the [[The Rusher War]]. During the war, the 4th Incursion (See [[Spawn Incursions]]) started in order to genocide any and all Rusher fans in spawn, as well as the [[Flatlands]]. These series of events is known as the Rusher Massacre, which has recorded a total of around 10,000 Rushers slaughtered.

The Rusher Era began to end after Rusher's first departure period, which was a period where Rusher did not play on the server for over a month, which ended the war. Rusher stated that he was apparently running out of ideas for the series and that the start of school was slowing him down. Rusher then returned on October 15th, 2016, however his return did not retrigger the war as his series was 

running out of steam and popularity. Rusher eventually left the server on October 22nd, 2016 when he posted his last 2b2t video and has not returned since. The second Rusher departure period officially ended the Rusher Era.
== New Factions ==
The Rusher Era also held one of the largest birthing of new factions in 2b2t.
* [[Team Aurora]], founded by NedaT to support the Veterans
* [[The 4th Reich]], created to create chaos
* [[The Peacekeepers]], founded by PandaSauceYT as a Pro-Rusher group
* [[The Turtles]], founded by some xTurtleFans fans
* [[The Resistance]], founded by CorruptedUnicorn with a goal to become as powerful as possible
* [[Team Rusher]]
* [[Team Veteran]]
== Trivia ==

* The phrase &quot;The oldest server in Minecraft&quot; became a meme with the 2b2t community due to Rusher using it in the titles of his 2b2t videos and saying it constantly. (However, 2b2t is not the oldest server in minecraft. The real oldest server in Minecraft is actually Minecraft Online, 2b2t is 2nd)
* Spambots became incredibly popular during this era
* Lag Machines also became popular as they were originally used to drive out Rushers as they could not play due to lag
* The 2b2t Wiki was made during this era.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1997">Sanctuaries are crop farms that reside within the area of spawn, or farther out along the nether highways. The term was dubbed by 2b2t players due to [[TheCampingRusher]] using it to describe these farms. Many people have made sanctuaries, from oldfags to newfags, either for the consideration of newfags at spawn to gain food on their ventures, or to make an attempt to save themselves from hunger. 
[[File:Screenshot 2016-12-11 at 9.29.03 PM.png|thumb|220x220px|Rusher Sanctuary about to be griefed by Fit]]The most notable sanctuary was the [http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/Valley_of_Wheat Valley of Wheat], which was the longest lasting and largest sanctuary on 2b2t. Now it is instead the 2nd most griefed place on 2b2t, the 1st being [[spawn]].

Another notable sanctuary, [[NFE (Negative Fourhundred Eighthundred)|NFE]], lasted a similarly long amount of time even closer to spawn, and was destroyed and rebuilt multiple times over the years.

Some of the most common ruins around spawn are the remains of ruined sanctuaries, ruined from people either deliberately griefing them or just never replanting. If players are lucky, they may find a sanctuary that has not been touched by griefers. A large amount of sanctuaries were built during the course of [[the Rusher War]] as many newfags attempted to survive the harsh conditions of the server at the time. Many of these were destroyed, as were many of the sanctuaries that existed previously, and now most of the existing sanctuaries are fairly new. In the coming weeks and months, one can expect lots of new sanctuaries to be built by the Ants.
[[File:AHesOqb-0.jpg|thumb|220x220px]]One common recruitment tactic is to make sanctuaries around spawn with signs instructing the player on how to join a certain group and to litter the sanctuary with propaganda for said group. This method was popularized by [[HolyBruhBrine]] in [[the Vortex Coalition]] .

''&quot;It is OK to leave ruins&quot; - Hermetiklock''

The Sandcastle Mentality is a philosophical concept, that is one of the pillars of the &quot;veteran mentality&quot;. It basically means that a player accepts the destructive nature of 2b2t, and learns to live with it.

== Origin ==
Due to its anarchistic nature, there's nothing on 2b2t, that would prevent anybody from griefing another player's build. Because of that, building on the server has always been problematic. While there's still a distance that's considered to be safe, every way you try to give meaning to your build, as posting pictures of it, or invite other players, you higly increase the posibility of griefing via explaits and betrayal (see also: [[The 2b2t youtuber's paradox]])

This raises the question, also known as [[Hermeticlock]] 's &quot;The Builder's dilemma&quot;: Why build on 2b2t?&quot;.

Though partly it's a variation of the &quot;What's the meaning of this&quot; question, that applies to every game, and also to the &quot;real life&quot;, on the other hand you can ask the question like &quot;Why build on 2b2t, instead of other, non-anarchy server?&quot;

As a player has to deal with the twisted morality of the server, he/she also must answer the question above. The possible answers can be the following:
* Fight against the basic nature of 2b2t. It is destined to fail.
* Isolate yourself to minimalise the threat. Then you can ask: &quot;Why is it better than playing in singleplayer?&quot;
* Eventually quit 2b2t
* Giving up on building anything remarkable
* Building, while accepting the fact, that the build will be eventually destroyed

== Concept ==
The Sandcastle Mentality is not a singular choice however, but the product of a player long-term experience, as the player sees the overall trends of the server, the quick rise and fall of bases and groups.

As seen above, only those who accept the nature of 2b2t can be part of it, accaptence and resignation are the ruling themes in this philosophy. It's major points are:
* Every building ever can and eventually will be destroyed. Nothing is 100% safe.
* Thus when you create, you also pave the way to destruction. These two cannot be separeted.

* There will always be griefers and griefing.
* Griefing is neither moraly good or bad, as morality doesn't apply to video games. It's just a thing that exists.
* If something is griefed, the best strategy is to move on. Making drama is pointless.

[[File:Converted file 0a13c4f8 converted.png|thumb|197x197px]]Sato86 is a midfag on 2b2t. He is known for his participation in Valkyria,  aiding in the construction of several bases, and a historian of the server. He is also known for his participation in the Rusher War. 

== History ==
{{2B2T_Player_Template|title1 = Sato86|approx_date_joined = |status = Active|known_alternates = Melkor|reddit_username = Sato_of_2b2t|affiliation(s) = |past_affiliations = |approx_join_date = Sometime in February of 2013|current_affiliation(s) = Independent|past_affiliation(s) = Team Veteran
Valkyria}}Sato86 first joined 2b2t sometime in February of 2013. He eventually teamed up with [[Pyrobyte]] and [[Drewbookman]], despite not having much of a reason to trust them, to create [[the Black Flag Group]] . Eventually, the Black Flag Group fused with [[Hitlerwood]] to create a new base project known as [[Valkyria]], which became the name that people around the server began to refer to the group. Hitlerwood was recognized as the last facepunch base as the members were all facepunchers. Members of it were Coldwave, Hinderjd, zach3397, KnightVista and infiltrate.

Sato would spend his time as one of the founders and leaders of Valkyria and remained with the group until its disbandment after the 3rd Incursion. During this time, he would found bases with his fellow comrades and explore the server to find relics of the early days of 2b2t. During his explorations of the server, he found the base known as [[Rhadamantis]] in which he claimed for Valkyria as the base was long abandoned.

He would also begin to create the 2b2t timeline during his time in Valkyria and began to learn about the servers history. This is when he started to become a historian and posted on James_Rustles' 2b2t blog.

=== Post-Valkyria, Pre-Hype Period, and Rusher Fiasco ===
When Valkyria disbanded after the 3rd Incursion, Sato continued to participate in bases with his former comrades and explore the server during the early days of the Pre-Hype Period. He participated in [[Project Vault]] in order to preserve 2b2t's most famous landmarks. Sato also disappeared a few times off the server due to the whole [[backdoors|backdoor]] fiasco with the hacking of an OP'd account. When [[Rusher Era|the Rusher Period]] began, Sato was one of the heads of [[Team Veteran]] , being temporary [[Spawn Incursions|4th Incursion general]] , and participating in several Rusher Massacres. 

=== Post-Hype Period ===
Once the war was over, Sato continued to play on the server, with a few in and outs. He eventually joined the [[Spawn Masons]] in May of 2017. This was his first official group since Valk, due to Team Veteran being more of a meme and a movement of sorts.  He has been a member since, even after the Masons’ initial disband and eventual revival in 2018.

When AntVenom declared

== Controversies ==
[[File:339px-2b2t-satoLegend.jpg|thumb|389x389px|Sato’s comic edit]]During 2016, Sato86 has received a lot of hate from several players due to rumors of his supposed “bias”, “attention seeking behavior”, and “better-than-everyone-else”  attitude. This was mainly due to the fact that a few midfags and oldfags, most being those who opposed Valk or left the server and had catching up to do, began to spread these rumors to the newfag population of the Rusher War. These rumors spread to several places all around 2b2t media, including the wiki, which soon fell victim. These rumors were never true as Sato has, on many occasions, recognized his faults and claims that he is an average Minecraft player.

Sato being called a legend has become somewhat of a meme on 2b2t. This was started when Rusher called him a legend in one of his videos where he showed a comment posted by Sato on Fit’s video. This, of course caused outrage (read above) and eventually turned into a meme. Even Sato acknowledged this meme with his comic edit.

He has also been accused of portraying a lot of Valkyria bias due to having most of the timeline be dedicated to the group. This was also prevalent during 2016, but the group in itself was atleast half of the small population at the time. The group just happened to gain immense member count and of course the group was going to have some sort of hand in most major events on the server. This has also turned into a meme that Sato acknowledged with a meme timeline. Of course, that does not mean Sato’s timeline is completely perfect, nothing truly is.

The Second Valkyrian Era, or the Fenrir Interlude, was a very short Era. The Era began with the founding of the Fenrir Project. The obsidian eagle became relevant once again as [[Asgard II]] was founded, and went on to have a population of 30 players, one of the biggest, if not the biggest, bases that the server had seen up to that time.

Asgard II was later destroyed when its coordinates were leaked, and the anger that arose from its destruction led the Asgardians to launch the 3rd Spawn Incursion (See [[Spawn Incursions]]). The Third Incursion ended with the completion of [[Wrath Outpost]] and the founding of [[Aureus City]].[[Category:History]]

'''Singularity''' is a small group of former [[VoCo]] members with the purpose of maintaining a loose form of government based off of a feudalistic structure and communal anarchist government.

The group was founded originally by HolyBruhBrine as 'The VoCo Life Raft' which served members who were banned by Sengorn_Leopardae after the fall of VoCo. The group evolved into Singularity over the course of roughly three days and multiple insurgencies. This came at the hands of Dakras, Savage Cyclops, Individualism, KXC_Style, T4nkplays, ImportedSocks, furleoxnop, and Fax.
[[File:Capture-0.PNG|thumb|244x244px|Singularity Banner]]

==History==
During the messy breakup of VoCo I, many members were not sure what was going on, and their superiors were not telling or making an effort to find out. [[HolyBruhBrine]] was a former Prime Minister (elected offical in charge of advising coltsnid) and recruiter who had recruited a large portion of VoCo's player base. When Members didn't get a clear answer from the Higher-ups they went to HolyBruhBrine for answers, HolyBruhBrine made a discord called ''The VoCo Life Raft ''for members who were being unfairly banned and kicked and using his rank tried to get as much information as he could to members which stopped a portion of the chaos.

When The VoCo discord was deleted the only remanent of VoCo was ''The VoCo Life Raft. ''After 2 days of the Discord being gone and no word from Coltsnid the members wanted to move on and make a group from the ruins of VoCo the was a huge debate over the name and in the end ''Singularity'' prevailed the group drafted [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_KSP349myt-sTgjwsKur0DxUhBF5iyfXGuGQ2uZRdhs/edit?usp=sharing a constitution]  deciding to have 7 ambassadors who each own a base and other rules.
[[File:.eJwNyEEOhCAMAMC 8ABKcSngbwgSNFFLaPe08e uHOdnvvM0q9lVh6wA2yGV52ZFeZbebGfuZyvjEFv5gqJa6n61WwV89IQupkA5BfTZESyY CcvgRLifzESoB13N88LOSwgEQ.png|thumb|220x220px|Singularity Flag]]
6 days after VoCo Fell coltsnid got in contact with Oreo and made a new VoCo II. People thought it was going to be a real group and even a few bases were made so most members of Singularity left to join VoCo, HolyBruhBrine, after there was only 11 members of the discord, decided to give VoCo II a try deleted the discord and joined VoCo II. It was not going to be a real group and after 3 days it was sold to a unknown person. People asked HolyBruhBrine to make a new discord and he did.

After all that it was smooth sailing HolyBruhBrine ammended the constitution promoted 7 ambassadors and each one built a base, as of it's death there were 7 ambassador bases 2 ally bases and dozens of privately owned bases. 

After The Vortex Coalition threatened HolyBruhBrine with the release of his dox he quit 2b2t disbanding Singularity. Most Singularity members now reside in [[The Emperium]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26651">{{Autism}}This page is dedicated to groups that existed on 2b2t but have not gained a lot of acknowledgement, disbanded very early, interacted with other groups, and/or did not do something of little significance to the server. Most of these groups are from [[Timeline|the Rusher Period]] and after. In order for these groups to be removed and gain their own page, they must create something large, gain lots of recognition by a medium sized population of 2b2t, or at least 30 members (post Febuary 2018).

'''UPDATE (June 2018): '''A new rule has been implemented, all groups to be declared as a small group must have a minimum of 5 members in their group at the time of being added. '''NO EXCEPTIONS'''. Any less wouldn't be considered a group. This is to filter out cringy fagtions that are run by 9 year olds or retards that have no idea what they are doing.

'''UPDATE (June 16th, 2018): '''The first rule can be a bit flexible depending on circumstances. If a group is like ~25 and has an actual activity and history, it will get it's own page. Also, if an oldfag group that was predominant but had few members due to varying populations of the server, they will get their own page. ALL FAKE GROUPS WILL BE PURGED, DON'T MAKE SHIT UP. Also, (NOT NECESSARY) to further validate the existence of your group, a permanent discord link would be appreciated to help us prevent fake groups from plaging the wiki.

'''UPDATE (June 17th, 2018): '''This is to emphasize on the fact that groups that have done major actions, builds, and contributions to the server will receive their own page,

== Note ==
A lot of this stuff may be incorrect and most of these are written based off of &lt;s&gt;a few Reddit posts and asking around as these groups are hard to access information on.&lt;/s&gt; the propaganda spammed by their members. Feel free to edit any posts that seem incorrect because you may know better than we do. Also, make sure to make the groups in order of their founding. The groups closer to the top of the page are recent groups, while the ones closer to the bottom are older ones (for the most part). Please note that 90% of these are autistic and [[fagtions]].

== Trojan ==
'''Goals:''' Trojan is a group that attempts to take down groups who harbor new players, through insiding, shitposting, griefing and whatever they can do in their power to take them down. They work on moderate sized build projects and they are currently working on a base called the Tenth City of Troy, and will soon start a build project named Liberty. They would like to become a group that can trust each other and share exploits, [[Duplication Glitches|dupes]], etc; with each other without worrying about it getting leaked.

'''Bases: '''Currently Trojan is working on a base called the Tenth City of Troy, due to how new the group is this is their only base. They will be creating [[spawn]] stashes soon, right after the completion of Troy.

'''Membership: '''Trojan is an invite only group as well as the discord. The only way to get in is to be invited by the leader, Jumpinqq. That is not easy because you need to be on good terms with their allies. You also must know Jumpinqq as that is the only way you can get in. The group is supposed to be uninsidable, meaning there is a lot of precautions in measure to make sure no one leaks coordinates, and group secrets.[[File:Trojan.jpg|thumb|304x304px]]

The Unidad Split (Exodus Side)

Around Early April 2018, YotoGamer goes inactive. The group begins to get insided, and after a big argument about the groups inactivity, PepperX_ polls for active members and creates a new discord in Late May - early June. Early June 2018, YotoGamer comes back and steps down from owner, giving ownership to PepperX_. After which Dr. Andrew causes a fight between YotoGamer and after a long and not so civil discuission, YotoGamer and Dr. Andrew split off from Unidad and remained in the original Unidad Discord. In the Discussions afterward, Unidad members vote and decided to change their name to Exodus. Since most of Unidad's active membership stayed with PepperX_, no bases or friends were lost.

=== History ===
Team Inferno was founded by a player named Rustbound in late 2017. Inferno grew slowly, mainly recruiting new 2b2t players. Notable players who were friends of Retronautx (current leader) joined the group as well, including IHackedWalmart, Killet, and Metrez. After a few months, Inferno continued its growth, but a conflict occurred with Rustbound which caused him to leave Inferno and left the group with player Retronautx in control. A player by the name of I_Love_Autism (ex-Inferno member) was responsible for the original Inferno HQ 's destruction. In early December 2017, a cold war between Inferno and their formally allied group, The Church Of Eden, broke out. However, this war was resolved approximately one week later. There were no battles fought. In late December 2017, the Valley of Wheat 2 (a spawnbase of Inferno's) was griefed without warning. Signs were found by one of Inferno's members claiming that VoCo was responsible, but this was proven false. Closely after, a large majority of Inferno bases were griefed due to insiders from Emperium. Retronautx then proceeded to ban ThejumpyBlazeftw and Racewizard, the supposed insiders.

[[File:Maxresdefault_(1).jpg|thumb|Team Mentos Logo]]Team Mentos is a group that made a public appearance in [[kekkekkek1|kekkekkek1's]] shitpost. The reason that the group exists is to meme [[Team Pepsi]]  by teasing them with the mentos and soda reaction. The group has some bases on 2b2t but these bases are built on top or near locations that [[TheCampingRusher]] have been to.

Team Mentos was created by kekkekkek1 with the main purpose of targeting Team Pepsi on December 27th, 2016. Although it didn't leave any mark on 2b2t until Febuary, 2017. Team Mentos has a client that was a ripped-off Impact client that changed all &quot;Impact&quot; to &quot;Mentos&quot; and a coord tracker built in. Whoever has the client active technically is a member of Team Mentos.

'''Team Malaria''' was a group whose goal was to be feared at spawn. The group split from [[Team Imperia]]

=== History ===
Team Malaria started when members of Team Imperia, [[Flyinqq]] , [[Sextinq]] , and [[Crystalinqq]] , split off due to arguments with Imperia hierarchy some time in December, 2016. The group moved on to attack anyone at spawn. The group decided to attack [[VoCo|VoCo's]] [[Gamma Base]] when they managed to inside the base thanks to the help of [[CokeQueen360]] . Luckily, all valuables were retrieved before the grief. In retaliation, VoCo sent one of their members, [[Salamander]] , to pose as an insider and give coordinates to CokeQueen's dupe stash to members of Malaria. Salamander posed the coords as actual VoCo bases and so Team Malaria ended up griefing their own team member's base.

Eventually, stability in the group did not last long as Flyinqq and Crystalinqq had an argument with Sextinq and split off to create [[Team Coca Cola]] . Sextinq continued to lead the group until they were insided by [[RusherIsAutistic]] and a lot of their items were lost. The group eventually withered away as former members got bored, lost hope, and/or joined other teams and eventually disbanded sometime in February of 2017.
=== Trivia ===
* Team Malaria was a democratized group where no action was taken without proper agreement between all the leaders and the highly ranked members.

* '''Team Malaria''' was also known as '''Team Disease, or Team Herpes''' for various reasons.

=== Relations ===
* [[Imperia]] - Imperia are enemies with Team Malaria

Team Imperia is a small rather neutral team that has had roots since early June though has only become more known by its players in October and November 2016. The team's Founder aswell as leader is TheDeathDoctrine, aswell as his fellow friend and leader niftyrobo.
[[File:Imperia Banner.png|thumb|240x240px|Imperia Banner]]

=== Early Days ===
Team Imperia officially began in October when TheDeathDoctrine's team, The Anarchists, and niftyrobo's team, The Inalegie, merged together to form Imperia.

Not much is currently known about the Anarchists, but the other half, The Inalegie, originally started in September when a Newfag named niftyrobo started a team called The Epists. The Epists started a base in The [[Flatlands]], but was later abandoned to form a base called PRAWN base. niftyrobo met TheDeathDoctrine when he bought a map from him, starting the friendship. The Epists went on to rename themselves The Inalegie, and let in more members like Crystalinqq, DemonCrown, and Nourdica. PRAWN base was griefed by [[AutismBot]] in late October when PeterRichards gave him the coords after finding the base by chance.

==== {{T/piece}}December Coup ====
The December Coup was a successful break of multiple members after the group involving disputes over a member in the group resulting in members to leave and create Team Malaria. The coup was spearheaded by players Crystalinqq and Flyinqq.

==== Imperia's Disband ====
Imperia disbanded on December 12, 2016. The reasoning for the sudden disband was due to the December Coup and the heavy loss of members leaving to join other groups. TheDeathDoctrine and Niftyrobo officially met the night of the 12th to discuss the future of the group and chose to discontinue the group.

==== Recreation ====
Imperia was revived about 2 weeks after it's disbanding but died again.

=== Relations ===
* [[The 4th Reich]] : Imperia is enemies with The 4th Reich for griefing [[Wrath Outpost]] and being a bunch of edgelords
* [[The Vortex Coalition]] : Imperia is enemies with The Vortex Coalition
* [[The Blind Eye Clan]] : Imperia attempted to ally the Blind Eye Clan, but failed due to the team disbanding
* Yamerockers : Imperia is allied with the Yamerockers
* [[The Peacekeepers]] : Imperia is allied with The Peacekeepers, but hate their banner
* [[Team Aurora]] : Imperia is highly annoyed by Team Aurora for being a bunch of violent faggots

Team V Fawkes was a group founded by lakililo, that formed just as [[the Rusher War]] started. The group kept a low profile by avoiding fights and remaining neutral. However, they did conduct small rusher raids and a few suicide bombings at spawn. Their group presented a lot of symbols related to Anonymous, V for Vendetta, and Guy Fawkes. Their motto was &quot;We Seek, locate, annihilate. We are united by one, divided by zero...!&quot;. The group only made one base and the members eventually begun to leave and lost contact with each other. Their main channel was owned by cityboss1, who eventually moved on from V Fawkes and founded the Asylum, even using the symbol and banner fron V Fawkes for the Asylum.

History

2b2tRiotPolice/JoeSSKing first joined several groups on server called 1b1t and joined 4b4t to make a group called the government which died after a betrayal in the base and a fight with withers which JoeSSKing went on to create a group with about 7 members on a server called no rules but played other servers also but went against a group ruled by racistbot which used the flag of the white banner neutralists the federation got smaller after there main base at the border got destroyed and then they went on and on the Fourth of July the two teams signed a treaty and celebrated America but JoeSSKing insists he ended the war then the federation was renamed the imperialists and now plays multiple servers. Over time JoeSSKing changed his name to JoeSSImperial and became more serious about anarchy and started learning about it well but after his name change to 2b2tRiotPolice it's almost as if it is a different person.

A splinter group of Highland founded by Scythe8252, LuigiBro74, ItsJaxo, and supeR after they were looked down upon by upper ranking members and their base was griefed by Highland members. The four went off to create the first generation of the Prussian Empire. The group currently has had 2 generations. Also, the group is a bit autistic.

The first generation was active for a few months, building a few castle like builds and later disbanded, with not much done. The second, however had more activety, starting with an apparent inside attempt on the Emperium and Scythes' small castle getting &quot;cucked by ThejumpyBlazeftw&quot; on March 14th, 2018 in retaliation. The group then allied with the Last Templars, which the alliance really isn't serious, and [[the Guild]], which was later crushed by the Emperium, Highland, and the Asylum. They later participated in the 6th Incursion, not being part of the actual Incursion group alliance and eventually went off to join Armorsmith's autistic [[Armorsmith’s Followers|Armorstate]] alliance.

The Turtles were a group that existed on 2b2t during the beginning of [[the Rusher War]] . Their leader was xTurtle, a notorious youtuber who hacks on minecraft servers. He posted a video about 2b2t on June 17, 2016, and created an 11 video series on it. His team was composed of his fans and they supposedly created a few newby bases. [[Team Veteran]] completely eradicated the group by slaughtering most of his fans early on during the war. xTurtle also left 2b2t because he died in the End. The group was similar to [[Team Rusher]] as the group was completely disorganized.

Team Eternity is a neutral group and was formed by Ultimate21Alex. Their main purpose is to back up groups or help groups during major conflicts. Their major ally is Infrared and neutral with Vortex Coalition.

The idea of Team Eternity began during the Rusher War but it wasn't created until the 6th incursion ended. After this Ultimate21Alex recruited fellow players to join and thus creating Team Eternity.

{{2B2T_Group_Template|title1 = Team Apex|approx_founding_date = June 2nd 2018|status = Active|#_of_members = 8|notable_members = KingOda, VillagerFilms}}Team Apex is a very small group formed by KingOda. They formed really just to survive for a bit, but have special plans for the future of the team that is more than just surviving together.

The group was originally a group on a non-anarchy SMP (Survival Multiplayer) server. However, when the user VillagerFilms asked for a team, KingOda had the idea to move Team Apex over to 2b2t. He invited many of the former Team Apex members to join them, thus forming Team Apex on 2b2t.

== The Stingers ==
The Stingers was a group formed by two people, Hornet2001 and HoneyBeeWing. It was formed on the Hive as a joke, but truly became a group after the duo joined a Serbian faction server. Its name was &quot;Zemlja Picke&quot; or something like that, meaning &quot;Land of Cunts&quot;, however the base shut down and little is left (if anything) of it. The group recruited some members, however, Hornet2001 was banned after accidentally using speedhacks in the lobby. 

Hornet2001 wanted to find a server were he could use his hacks at will, and found 2b2t. The group migrated there and made their first few bases not so far away from spawn, and unsurprisingly, all were griefed. [[File:APEXLOGO.PNG|thumb|220x220px]]After a while, they invited a player going by the name of pitp0tpat, who had vast resources, probably from a dupe. With these resources, Hive Castle was built. Hive castle was their finest base yet and their last. It was built far out, but their mistake was that a few 1000 blocks away from Hive castle was another base that invited newfags, so they found the base and destroyed it.

After the grief of their largest base yet, they split up and quit 2b2t. HoneyBeeWing continued to play minecraft on a parkour server, but after a while, he got tired and perma quit Minecraft in late 2016.{{2B2T_Group_Template|title1 = The Stingers|approx_founding_date = 2013, migrated to 2b2t in late 2014|status = Disbanded|#_of_members = ~5 - 10|notable_members = Hornet2001, HoneyBeeWing and pitp0tpat}}[[Category:Factions]]

== Early Days ==

== Rusher and Post-Rusher Days ==

== Aureus City Incident ==
During the Rusher-Era and the influx of new players, one of those new players known as [[CancerChan]] formed a close relationship with SnackyNorph by pretending he was a girl. Taking advantage of SnackyNorph's desperate need for female attention and intimacy, CancerChan catfished SnackyNorph into basing together and forming a relationship that was borderline autistic internet boyfriend/girlfriend-like relationship, even with exchanges of nude photographs of each other (CancerChan used nude photos of his ex-girlfriend). The two would form a couple of bases together, with at least one or two of them being dupe bases from the 11/11 dupe event.

SnackyNorph planned on taking his new found 'female' companion on a tour of the places he bases or notable locations, and had planned on taking CancerChan to see [[Spartan-512]] 's pony map (whose destruction solidified Spartan's permanent retirement from 2b2t). SnackyNorph, set on a course to another base he shared with DemonElite119, he pointed CancerChan in the general direction of where to go, without revealing exact coordinates to the map or Aureus City.

This, however, did not stop CancerChan from finding [[Aureus City]] . CancerChan, fueled by a hatred for Fit and his shenanigans with Team Veteran which he viewed as further fueling the roleplay war TheCampingRusher and Fit were carrying out for Youtube attention, would go on to bait and social engineer his way to Aureus City via means of poking at CainesLaw, a notable oldfag and founder of the base. CainesLaw inadvertently confirmed a general location for the base and its coordinates, allowing CancerChan to leak it to the general public. This put [[CainesLaw]] , and [[Fit]] —whose musuem was located at Aureus city—into full panic mode.

Thanks to SnackyNorph's general association with CancerChan and their constant portrayal as an e-couple, SnackyNorph took much of the blame for the incident which was further fueled by Fit when he put a video out about the destruction of the base, laying full blame for it at SnackyNorph's feet. This led to the loss of most of SnackyNorph's 2b2t companions, and he would exile himself from other bases he was occupying.

This all culminated with Snacky having virtually no friends left on the server, save for a few although he would later turn on at least one of them for dubious reasons. CancerChan has since leaked an entire Skype conversation with SnackyNorph, as well as two photographs of him, one of them revealing his penis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9709">=== '''''Sniper's Peaceful Island [ 3rd April 2017 - 16 January 2018]''''' ===
&quot;Back when we had started this name was suggested by a guy named Zexesl2, a french 2011 player. We were casually talking as always and this guy just says out straight,&quot;Sniper, why not simply name it snipers peaceful island since its both very peaceful and its an island started by yourself?&quot;. Well back then I had just accepted and now as this is a 13 and more member base its about time to express its existence, the memories which are linked with it and all the members who are a part of this base.&quot;

&quot;Back when I had started, I was making my way somewhere and this base... was like a replenishing area for me to carry on with my journey which is still on and incredibly amazing. So here I am just digging in nether.. digging... digging... digging.. made a portal... below an ocean, made another portal.. fuckin GG!!! an island with pigs and cows. Back then I had wurst client and God bless Sage_Mathias for his autofisher design, I made that and made a small cobble wall around it. Later, some skeleton riders had spawned around its vicinity and I managed to grab one skeleton horse. Being a 'One Piece' fan i named him'' ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'bonekichi-sama', he still lives to this day as I type this tbh. Moving on lets talk about a random day, I'm moving on ahead I called on P529 at my base since he had speed hack probably timer on pig or horse.. and P529 came and dropped me a bunch of Shulkers. like 12-14. Before I packed up and left I called upon a guy named Zexesl2. Zexy and I met randomly through a really fucked up incident. When I say fucked up I mean, here I am saying I got terminal cancer in chat, trying to seek sympathy and stuff from people, being an attention seeker and a good convincing guy I managed to convince Zexy that I have cancer and Zexy messaged me on skype, later he added me on facebook. Now by this time I had told him that who I was and how I am gonna leave and all and Zexy came to the Island. we developed stuff like I made some decorative stuff like developed the autofisher and made a small map spot and mapped the island. Zexy was on the other hand, took a render, made a dual zombie grinder, skeleton grinder, birch farm , oak farm , super simple fast growing farms. He was really good at farms and still is.

Here is a render from the time we had just begun:

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;[[File:17807187_149134805614367_1221309622_n.jpg|left]]&lt;/p&gt;



This is the render from when Brother [[P529]] had come by and dropped shulkers by my bed and zexy had began developing the island already:

[[File:17911031_153723618488819_1702781798_n.jpg|left]]

This is a picture of when Zexy had just started making them farms and was multplying the trees:[[File:17909413_155739714953876_1074629649_n.jpg|left]]
[[File:17910680 1471779736193897 477194681 n.png|thumb|218x218px|none]]

About [[P529]] and [[UFOcrossing]] , these both guys were pretty new for me back then,

despite knowing each other I for some reason thought that,

&quot;UFOcrossing was into boys and was a griefer&quot; for God knows what reason,

so I had called brother P529 alone.

He did come by and dropped the shulkers, he later visited this place like after 6 months or so to see the phenomenal growth but it was totally not expecting this many number of players to be living here lol.

The Pic is of brother P at the island. God bless him for he's helped so many in our times.

Moving on ahead, the major part of island became active during the phase of June 2017 to August, during this period I met two players called ELVEng and Auchzezt, ELVEng was a wanted guy by cops and was a big strong guy IRL whereas Auchzezt was just a little lonely traveller on 2b2t. ELVEng later went on to become a major part of highland and participated in many projects while DieloTai ( Once a GrandMaster { Top Highland Rank} ) was a part of it. He and Auch also participated in the South Canal Corp when it was upto 100k and househousehouse1 (Jeff Wilkins) began griefing it and ThebesAndSound asked the aid of fellow mates to modify and repair it (can't confirm if he really asked help or people just joined). Sage_Mathias had been on 12 June 2017. He was like visiting on an Alt account. Later fellow mates like Drachenstein and DrewBot9000 came on and went away after some time, they come and go and jsut dig out the portal as they wish.
[[File:Slappn and Snipe.PNG|thumb|380x380px|centre]]

During this time Slappn and I had a trade in which I gave him

direct invite to the Island and a rare book which had its coords in it and

Slappn being an old friend came and payed his respects sinerely.

Heres a few pictures while modifications were happening over time to the island. Modifications in the form of massive landscape changes both necessary and essential for area and space effective allocation.
[[File:2017-11-14_12.13.04.png|thumb|685px|centre]]

Auch had come quite some time ago before ELVEng and while Auch had come by he mainy deicded to make an ocean gape similar to offtopia's drain but not necessarily copied it. He just ran out of creativity and made a nice old alpha style hut (Home but it looks like a hut). ELVEng came in contact with us like he wanted and elytra and me and others took the gamble and called him only to know that he's a grand architect like us and me made a big concrete sandstone birch fort style build. Hes currently making a big boat.



[[File:Auch and Snipe.PNG|thumb|220x220px|centre]]

Then came Lotus , Fluffbuck3t and Drach Child ( like he's a way nice guy but C and D alphabets rhyme while reading somehow so let's call him Drach Child) so these guys were invited next, I didnt trust lotus and fluff over this tbh but they came and left us lots of stacked goodies. Before them all ToySoldier was here, he also recieved lots of gifts from Lotus. Toy Boy made only one but master build. A big sanctum with its own aura and speciality.[[File:Lotus_Home_Inside.PNG|thumb|675px|centre]]

Images from top to bottom (4 images) : 1. Interior of Lotus's home; 2. Build of Lotus and Fluffbuck3t ;

3. Build of ToySoldier 4. Myne1001's south canal memorial and auch's inprogress lighthouse

Myne1001 had coords of island since he was a part of the main Valinor group. Then was the addition of barrendome and along with it was drewbot9000. I personally didnt know drewbot9000 but if sage mathias trusted him I directly added him into the group and gave coords. He also hasnt build anything so far. He's got space allocated already.

Barrendome made, concrete colour changer, afk skeleton farm , afk fish farm , smooth stone generator and brought us all lots of gifts and a shulker of coals for fluffbuck3t. You might remember his chirstmas video in which he mentions a shulker of coal for fluffbuck3t.

[[File:Snipe_and_Drewbot.PNG|thumb|675px|centre]]

These are around Nov - Dec 17. ELVEng had made a stable and I made a melon pumpkin kinda road and a residential area. You can see that in the Drewbot9000 background. Zexesl2 made an underground railway after experimenting and Ice boat speed transport. I made two squiggles statues for herms. Just like that, for fun.[[File:2017-11-30_20.40.14.png|thumb|681px|centre]]

This is the beacon on the island. Behind it is a mass carpet duping station and its got farms on all floors except the ground floor. Because on ground floor is carpet duping apparatus. Theres even a region for growing purpur plants.

This is the residential area:

The above two images are the first two images of the peaceful island.

The island was destroyed by: its actually given in detail with a wdl link here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t/comments/7qrb2k/oremongoloid_and_theniggerof2b2t_found_the/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link

Oremongoloid and TheNiggerof2b2t found the peaceful island, aka Fr1kin , IAmTuna and Jared2013.

I've no idea how they found it but probably via like umm.. the coordinate exploit or someone traced it back to the island over world or someone leaked coords, but it was honourable to let it blown up by respectable oldfags. The coords were [-21160 X -1260Z Nether] . Thank you for reading.

Unexpected Edit: The base was griefed by Autismbot and his friends just for lulz. I feel terrible writing this but I fucked up calling slappn without knowing he was a 4thReich Member. But what is done is done. Zexy , Auch, Toy barely play. I barely play... but hey it was a grand time and much a relevant base. Thanks again.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2768">== Duration and Life Story in Short [9th Feb 2018 - 10 July 2019] ==
This project eventually began during the time after the Original and a prior Base called Sniper's Peaceful ''Island'' had been griefed, there was a period of stagnation and decay but just uptil now we didnt knew that slappn was the reason for the grief of the base. So during that time we removed Lotus and Fluffbuck3t and a bunch of others, Auchzezt had also quit by this time. So of all coordinates I decided to select an area close to fucking 300k +X over world. Expectedly we were found surprisingly fast. We were found by a kid called ILikeTrains. Well what he did was the leak the coords to Infrared. I dissolved the group and terminated the projects underway. The islands and the designs were simply fabulous to begin with as from the bare starting we can see that the fucking enormous statues and terraforming and submerged groups. Later what happened is retro and some shitheads came and placed signs. So the Freelancers and Emperium and Voco came and nuked it. Bloctagon from freelancers and DarkEmperor apologised. There was a minor misunderstanding as to me being rude to emperor but I was abusing ILikeTrans and infrared for fucking the shit up. I myself was to blame for selecting glorious 300k coordinate. But thats how the story of this base goes for now.

[[File:2b2t-SPI2.png|none|thumb|839x839px]]

== The Story of Peaceful Island's ==
Well as I had mentioned earlier the project was started after the stagnation phase post the grief of the Single Island. So we thought why not have multiple islands with personal designs. I was going to use my classic design of spruce concrete terracotta. Sage was going for his wooden art style of birch and acacia. Tod and Drewbot went for underwater builds. Massive scale designs. ELVeng actually managed to pull off a full scale design. 

So when we decided to not involve fluffbuck3t in the group we had chosen a massive island to base upon you see, we cancelled that and I choose this sea full of islands. We found this with the help of biomefinder and stuff. I came here on Patawette. Before me came ELVeng and Todarac. Then came zexy, sage, drewbot9000 and myself.

Dont really think anyone else was involved.

We went on about our builds, sage found other mycelium biomes. Then again he made a forest and stuff in the sea. He went as far as to build miniature islands. The thing with our bases is the variation in themes and just plane exploration feels fun. I could'nt get to build here but thats another part since I was busy IRL. ELVeng was the guy who made a statue called Lucy and it was magnificent. Guy went full scale digging mode and build so so much. Nobody could have expected it at a simple base as ours.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6614">Lists of social classes that are widely known on 2b2t

== Social Classes ==

== General Social Classes ==
* Ancientfags - Players who logged on in the first month of 2b2t's life. Not many are known as no one has concrete proof of being on the server on 2010, but Hausemaster and Georgebush420, as they created it.

* Oldfags - Usually players that have been around for a good four or so years and have accomplished great things. There are still few players that still play 2b2t since 2011/2012, an example would be Policemike55 and Xcc2.
* Midfags - A term coined to sate players like CytotoxicTcell who weren't total newfags, but weren't oldfags. They were players who were generally accepted by Oldfags in part thanks to their merits as players.
* Newfags - Players that are new in relative comparison to oldfags. It's commonly accepted that any oldfag can call a player that has joined later than them a newfag, even if they are also oldfags. The term newfag encompasses players typically from 2016 to present, as of late. This will change as time passes.
** Newfriends/Newspawn - This term is an acceptable replacement for the term &quot;newfag&quot; and is generally seen as a more polite way of addressing newer players. Ex. ''&quot;Come here, newfriend, I'll give you some steak and wood&quot;''
* Yesterfags - Newfags that have joined within the past 24h of the mention. Beyond 24h is just newfags/newfriends, so nobody is a yesterfag for long!
* Rusherfags/Rushers/Junefags - Another synonymous term for Newfag. These players joined after June 1, 2016, when YouTuber 'TheCampingRusher' uploaded a video titled &quot;THE OLDEST SERVER IN MINECRAFT&quot;, subsequently bringing in thousands of players, leading up to the creation of the queue and the beginning of The War, The Hype Era (Also called &quot;The Rusher Summer/Era&quot; by some players) and the rise of many groups across the server. These players typically came from the video Rusher posted and aren't really over the age of 13 in most cases. Being called this term does not necessarily indicate a person's affiliation with [[Team Rusher]] but rather a general statement.
* Ants/Antfags - These are the fans of [[AntVenom]], who made a video on 2b2t in April 2018. 
* Spawnfags/PVPfags - These are the players that are frequently hanging out at spawn or spawn camping 0,0 in both the nether and overworld. Many players use the term negatively because all some of these players seem to want to do is sit at spawn/kill newfags and not do anything &quot;productive.&quot; Spawnfag also suggests PVP combat, which is easy to get involved in as there is an abundance of both geared and naked players at spawn. Most of these players are highly geared so they can survive attacks of other hostile players.  

=== Rusher's Social Classes ===
* OGs - The extremely broad and vague term created by TheCampingRusher to define Oldfags as a group of which he planned to defeat in The War. The reasoning behind his using of this name was his reluctance to swear, let alone hack on the server.
* Nakeds- A term used by Rusher to refer to the Newfags/Rushers at spawn who did not have any gear. Can also be used to describe players without armor on. 

=== Extra Social Classes ===
* 2b2ter - A term used to for any player of 2b2t (not commonly used)

* Jewtuber- A term used to describe YouTubers on the server which the general playerbase thinks is basically just in it for the money. This can be used ironically or as an insult depending on the context and the person it involves.
* TacoFags/SpanishFags - These are the Spanish-speaking players that joined mostly from YouTube from September 2017 to now. 900k subscriber YouTuber ElRichMC, who made a video on the server, is the main source of these players.
* Frenchfag - a term originally to be used for the fans of AgentGB due to him being a french youtuber. It was barely used as AgentGB decided not to make a series about the server however it was spammed in his video's chat and towards some small influx of french players joining the server.
* Facepuncher - a term not commonly used anymore by players but is still applicable. The term refers not only to players of the [[Facepunch Republic]] but to anyone who joined due to the Facepunch forums, similar to how Rushers not only applies to players in [[Team Rusher]] but rather anyone who joined due to Rusher. Only a few players continue to wear this title such as Popbob, DemonElite119, xcc2. It is synonymous with Oldfag.
* 4channer - another term rarely used anymore that refers to anyone that joined 2b2t due to 4chan. It was also used to refer to the players in the long disbanded [[4channers]] group. Unlike the Facepuncher term, players who did join due to 4chan barely use the title. Offtopia and THEJudgeHolden are a few examples of players who would be labeled a 4channer. It is synonymous with Oldfag.
* Poorfag/Richfag - These terms are used to describe the amount of in-game wealth a player has. Typically the richest players will have multiple geared accounts and multiple stashes. Although most Richfags are not newfags, the terms have nothing to do with join date. Currently, most of the server's &quot;regulars&quot; are Richfags because of the large dupes that allow for previous Poorfags to become Richfags in a small amount of time, also helped by the introduction of shulker boxes into the game. 

== Discrepancies ==
There is no agreed time limit at which a player becomes an oldfag. Some claim that anyone that joined after 2011 is a newfag, others say that those who joined before 2015 are oldfags, and some say that those who joined in 2013 are midfags. It's all subjective, really. It usually is that players who joined during the first three years of the server are oldfags (2010-2013), the second two years are midfags (2014-2016), and current time are newfags (2016-Present). As years go on, these intervals will most likely grow by 1 year (ie after 2018, oldfags will be players who joined in 2010-2014, and newfags will be players who joined from 2017-present.)

While these terms ''can'' be used in a hostile manner, on 2b2t they are a part of everyday conversation. When used in a hostile manner, it will usually be for midfags who claim themselves to be a oldfag and everyone else is a newfag, when a newfag asks newby questions like &quot;can i hack on this server?&quot;, &quot;how do i get out of spawn?&quot;, and &quot;how do I get food? Can someone gimme food?&quot;, and for oldfags who claim to be gods and untouchables on the server because of how long they have played on the server (cocky and snotty douches basically).

== History ==
Space Valkyria was built by a player named [[JackTheRippa]], and was the biggest End bases in all of 2b2t history. Space Valkyria was built thousands of blocks out so no one would find it. One of the main reasons why this build was possible, was because Jacktherippa had several infinites; rare [[Hacked Items|glitched blocks]] which were able to be placed more than once. As the base progressed and expanded, jacktherippa started to invite more players to his base. Along with the base, Jacktherippa would collect and store [[Player Heads|player heads]] at Space Valkyria, essentially starting the first museum on 2b2t.

Once the update 1.9 was released, [[c1yd3i]] and [[jared2013]], betrayed jacktherippa, and withered the base&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSNziKN_D8c| 2b2t: housekeeping at Space Valkyria w/ D4RKJ0E]&lt;/ref&gt;. The two griefers, using [[iTristan|iTristan's]] [[Backdoors|backdoor]] access, teleported to Space Valk almost instantly and created an ender portal back to the overworld. Almost all of Space Valkyria was destroyed beyond repair, and it still remains in that condition to this day. The only known person who had found Space Valkyria, other than people invited, before the grief was [[Fit]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJI0iaxoPf0| 2b2t: Ruins of Space Valkyria]&lt;/ref&gt; on accident in 2015. After he took a look around he continued his journey into the End for his own project, the DFC. Despite Space Valkyria being in ruins, the legacy of the build will live on. Space Valkyria has also recently been confirmed to be in the upcoming &quot;[[Project Vault]]&quot;. The [[The 4th Reich|4th Reich]] also payed a visit to Space Valkyria and griefed its remains as much as they could&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IxCSXPQUDI| 2b2t: FitMC's Sacred Ruins Get Violated (Space Valkyria)]&lt;/ref&gt;. Jacktherippa also gave out a world download for the general public in Fit's short cinematic video on Space Valkyria.
== Architecture ==
This base contained many floors, which all served a specific purpose. It consisted of several beacons hanging from the ceiling as a light source, instead of using more traditional ways.

2b2t’s Spawn is centered on x0, z0 and the area that surrounds it, though very few people agree on how far out the term &quot;spawn&quot; means, the Wikia defines it as 20k blocks from 0,0. Like its name suggests, Spawn is the starting point for new players and the place where players without beds respawn, making it the most populated place on 2b2t.
[[File:XudxgLo.jpg|thumb|220x220px|1000X1000 Range of Spawn]]

== Inner Spawn ==
Spawn was first made in the early Beta version of Minecraft as a forest, a far cry from what is now. Spawn is usually described as cobblestone hell because of its many cobblestone mountains made from lava casts. Spawn also has many abandoned houses littering the area, along with bridges, swastikas, ruined farms, etc. 0,0 tends to be the hardest part to traverse due to it having no continuous ground, instead being made up of patches of blocks, requiring players to jump / build across them to travel.

=== Notable Spawn Locations ===
There are several notable areas within the 2000x2000 area at spawn. These include but are not limited to:
* The lava walls: this giant wall of cobblestone (sometimes lava) was originally a plan to keep Rushers contained in spawn during [http://2b2t.wikia.com/wiki/The_Rusher_War The Rusher War]. It surrounds the original 500x500 spawn radius. There is another lava wall around 1.5k of spawn made by the player Nordic93[[File:Aj73d57.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Lava Wall]][[File:Screenshot 2016-12-18 at 4.19.03 PM.png|thumb|220x220px|Wrath Outpost]]
* Wrath Outpost: an outpost made when [http://2b2t.wikia.com/wiki/Valkyria Valkyria] called for the third spawn incursion for the destruction of Asgard II.
* x420 y69 z911: [http://2b2t.wikia.com/wiki/The_Vortex_Coalition The Vortex Coalition] official spawnbase, made of lavacast to defer griefers, and continually destroyed and rebuilt.[[File:Wrath of voco-0.png|thumb|220x220px|Wrath of VoCo]]
* Operation Poseidon's Water Cube: Operation Poseidon was an attempt made by Team Veteran to cause difficult travel through spawn for Rushers by flooding it with water. It failed when the water cube began to freeze over due to snow biomes surrounding spawn and several people using the frost walker enchant to freeze it aswell. It is currently mostly destroyed. 
* 5th Incursion Obsidian Wall: A failed attempt by the 4th Reich to create Jared2013's 5th Incursion Wall. It is highly recommended to stay away from this wall as it is populated by several withers. This wall is next to the border between Inner and Outer Spawn.[[File:Maxresdefault (4).jpg|thumb|220x220px|Obsidian Wall]]
* The Water Cube: The Water Cube is obviously a large cube of water made by DiscoRae, Stlavs, flip and several people that engulfed a large portion of spawn. The water cube reached to 500 blocks in every direction and went up to the build limit (actually making it a cuboid). Its original purpose was to make travel difficult for newfags but claims state that it infact does the opposite as newfags no longer have to travel rough terrain and can simply swim through spawn. There are many air pockets and the bottom is usually the cobble monster hell mentioned above. It was created using airships to make the water sources spread. In 2017 April a movement started to destroy the Cube, and &quot;make the Spawn dry again&quot;. A large portion of the water cube has been drained by numerous people.[[File:7RafzbL.png|thumb|220x220px|Water Cube]]
* NFE: Negative Fourhundred Eighthundred was originally a 'sanctuary' for newfags. [https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t/comments/55ttyh/the_history_of_xcc2_and_nfe_as_told_by_xcc2/ It was maintained by xcc2 and x0xP for some time]. It was also a Forward Operation base used by Valkyria during the Second Incursion and was used along with Wrath Outpost during the Third Incursion. Its name is the coordinates of the base. The base was destroyed and rebuilt numerous times, with it currently now just ruins.
* Project Obsidian Sky: An obsidian roof above the 500x500 region of spawn that was built mainly by The Highland. It makes this part of spawn much easier to travel over.
* 6th Incursion Obsidian Wall: This is a wall that was built during the sixth incursion that is made entirely of obsidian that was generated from ender chests using slave labor. It is both a joke and a wall to attempt to keep the AntVenom fans trapped in spawn. It didn't work due to the large amount of people blowing holes through it with withers. Unlike the 5th, this one was completed, and stands much taller. 
* Wither Cave: Under Spawn is a cave where most of the underground is blown out completely, leaving only some water, lava and vines growing in here. The reason why other blocks (besides the bedrock floor) are not common here is because this is where most of Spawn's wither population lives. It is possible to get back up from here if you land somewhere without many withers and some water to swim back up to the surface. 
* Purgatory 3: After the grief of [[Purgatory 2]], the Builders Haven members had a plan to meme some of the griefers by building a base at 0 0. The base lasted for a day and hardly is known about this temp base. 
* 200 150: Probably one of the closest non-meme spawn bases ever made, if not the closest. Built by Armorsmith's Followers and griefed by the Spawn Masons because they built a lodge there, this base lasted for over 4 months in the begining of 2018. 

== Outer Spawn ==
Outer spawn is a bit more flat than Inner Spawn, but is still littered with ruins and the occasional lava
cast. While there are usually no animals in Outer Spawn, farms are a bit more common to come across. Outer spawn is home to many frozen oceans and deserts due to the biome settings being tampered with when weather was implemented into Minecraft. Outer spawn is also home to many of 2b2t’s monuments such as:
[[File:Hqdefault (2).jpg|thumb|187x187px|2k2k lavacasted
]]
* 2k2k: An old [http://2b2t.wikia.com/wiki/Facepunch_Republic Facepunch] base which is located x:-2000 z:-2000 hence the name. The base is currently a large cobble monster, however, players can find rooms and ruins inside the monster of the original base.[[File:Valley of Furnaces.png|thumb|220x220px|Valley of Furnaces]]
* Valley of Furnaces: A Valley surrounded by several lava pillars and cobble monsters with a large amount of furnaces in the center.
* Basti's Canyon: A large canyon made by Team Veteran during a test run with Basti's bomber during the third and final attempt to make spawn more difficult for Rushers to traverse. The attempt was abandoned due to people being able to grief the bombers and bed/crystal bombers.
* HermeticLock's Spawn Base: A spawn base built by HermeticLock that is currently a battleground and in ruins.
* 40K-80K Ocean: In 2011, the terrain generation of Beta 1.8 caused endless ocean to generate after a few kilometers from the world spawn, in this period someone traveled the south axis, and by doing so created an ocean over 40k long. Similar oceans can be found on the other axises as well.[[File:AstJkDV7ALFO1L6-AXYunXTCgknG3TZ4dxZ7r0MRvBs.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Small 4k Portion of Ocean]]
[[File:Maxresdefault (3)-0.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Basti's Canyon]]

== Dangers ==
x0, z0 is considered to be the most dangerous place in spawn for many reasons. There are usually two reasons why: other players who will kill you on sight, and the difficulty in traversing the terrain. Spawn has no animals for many thousands of blocks, and farms are usually destroyed within days of being made. This makes escaping spawn for new players extremely difficult (without hacks), and has become a sort of test to determine who can survive on 2b2t and who cannot.

However, escaping spawn becomes somewhat easy if the newfriend has hacks in which he can use speed hacks to get far enough to find food and is cautious on the highways without losing too much hunger. As of lately due to the 11/11 dupe, the highways and spawn are filled with withers, however they can be easy to avoid if you know where they are by using either mob tracers or xray.

== Spawn Incursions ==
Spawn Incursions are invasions of spawn, usually by a large group, with the intent to cause mass genocide at spawn to show their dominance on the server or attempt to contain a flood of newfags. See more on the [[Spawn Incursions]] page

== The Future ==

The future of spawn is unknown. Spawns future is dependant on the population of the server and the heat around it. Currently, spawn is facing huge amounts of destruction daily. Those whom seldom visit spawn regularly, and return after a period of time absent, may find themselves looking at a nearly different area. Its expected that the x,0 z,0 coordinates and the area surrounding it will be a complete bedrock crater, and the area surrounding it will turn into this too. Its likely that eventually the increasing prevalence of lava casts and blocking walls will stop newfags from leaving, making Hause possibly have to remove said structures for the servers health. It may also be possible that the spawn radius is increased, leading to an increase in the region where spawn lies, causing destruction in border forests and relatively quiet places. Due to the new water mechanics in the upcoming 1.13 update, there have been plans to flood spawn using flying machines and turn it in to a gigantic ocean. This will cause many new players to drown almost immediately upon joining the server, and will possibly make it much harder to escape spawn.[[Category:Places]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21683">Spawn Incursions are invasions of spawn by a particular, usually strong, group in which the group attempts to hold spawn for a period of time, slaughter enemies, persecute newfags, and mostly get attention and fame. Currently, there has been 6 incursions of spawn. The first three incursions were all caused by Valkyria, while the 4th was caused with betrayal drama between a “rusher” and Fit, 5th was caused by the player [[jared2013]], and the 6th was started by [[Sato86|Sato]].
[[File:TheHistory converted.png|thumb|220x220px]]
Note: The information of the first three incursions is from Sato86 on www.jamesrustles.com

== Forward Operation Bases ==
Forward Operation Bases (FOB for short) are bases built by incursion-eers as foothold bases around spawn during an incursion. These bases are mainly used by the players in order to rest, repair armor, set spawn points, re stack on food and gear, etc. They can vary from being small bases made of cobble to large monster bases made of rare and luxurious blocks. Currently, FOB's are usually being made out of pure obsidian following the construction of Wrath Outpost. Doing this is supposed to make FOB's look intimidating and sustain structure over long periods of time to act as &quot;permanent marks&quot; on the server due to obsidian being able to sustain a lot of damage.

=== Notable FOB's ===
* Wrath Outpost
* [[Greetings From Baghdad|Baghdad]]
* NFE
* Fourth Reich's FOB
* Wrath of VoCo
* 2k2k
* Fubster Spawn Camp
* Spawn slave labor camps

== First Incursion ==
'''The “Boredom” Incursion'''

'''Base of Origin: Valkyria'''

'''Spawn Base: 2k2k.'''

'''Estimated duration: 1 week'''

The First Spawn incursion happened during June, 2013

&quot; Yes, the first incursion was motivated by boredom. At the time we didn’t even call it incursion… This is now June of 2013. The first version of Valkyria is almost complete regarding the buildings and most basemates were tired of building and basing. Hindejd, one of five founders of Valkyria came to us with the idea of “invading” spawn. Usually that idea would be refused, but the conditions were perfect because of the 1.4.7. Everyone at Valkyria was extremely well equipped with Kino duped armor, tools and weapons which means we would have a chance to stand equal to any veteran spawn killer we could find.

We accepted this idea and marched to spawn, but not all together. Some people went a few days ahead of the rest, like Drewbookman and Hinderjd. They were important to settle some farms to sustain us. Half of the players of Valkyria were not online at the time or refused to come. After walking for hours at spawn and killing all the withers we could find, we decided to settle at 2k2k.

2k2k was a symbolic place for players like hinder, coldwave and knightvista, since it was a former Facepunch base. The newfag haven of Phagocytic. That was the main reason why we picked it. The place was not in bad conditions despite a giant lavacast. The underground was beautiful. But despite the good start, the first incursion became a mess. People started to separate to pursue their goals at spawn. We were not organized at the time, so 2k2k soon fell to griefers. Some of us also died, including me. This was due to the fact that even with good equipment, some of us still lacked the PVP experience. Spawn also made its role by killing some of us by fall damage. The whole event lasted only 1 week with a few ripples because some members remained at spawn for a bit more time.

The First Incursion failed… But no one really cared about it at the time. We wanted a challenge and we bite more than we could chew.&quot;

=== Groups Involved ===
* [[Valkyria]]

* Random [[Spawnfags]]

== Second Incursion ==
'''The Chaotic Incursion (AKA The IGN Incursion)'''

'''Base of Origin: Belegost, Valkyria, Rhadamantis.'''

'''Spawn Base: Fubster Spawn Camp, NFE.'''

'''Estimated duration: 2 months and half'''

The Second Incursion occurred during August of 2013. It was also the longest incursion to date.

&quot;Yes, this one was even messier than the first. The Second Incursion was marked by the lack of organization and surprising collaboration between the players involved. Unlike the first one, everyone's goals were the same: occupy spawn and kill everyone you see. Some of its (good) standards would become a reference for the third one. It happened after Belegost, the base that was supposed substitute Valkyria was accidentally leaked by Coldwave when he used Adolf client. This scattered the Valkyrians a lot. Some came with me to Rhadamantis, but some didn’t. Tired of running, some people went to their solo bases or friends.

Soon after Rhada, I stopped playing for a few months. I returned to 2b2t in August and was immediately invited by Pyrobyte to come to spawn and join this new invasion that was going on. 2b2t players numbers increased by this IGN post where 2b2t was considered one of the 6 greatest wonders of Minecraft. This motivated some veterans and Valkyrians to take arms and go to spawn to get some “fresh meat”.

The Second Incursion base started as a dirt hut built by Fubster. A few days later, a whole base took shape and served as a foundation for the impressive 2 months and half of occupation. Fubster, Pompano, Pyrobyte and I were the captains and administrators. We built roads, bases and beacons. But all of these improvements were used to maximize the killing and make it easier to patrol all directions. We would judge who was worthy or not to join the event.

The fact is that the second incursion was a genocide of newcomers. It brutally broke the players income and gave them a taste of how awful 2b2t can be. New players would be stalked and killed all day, every day. Week after week. Some earned our mercy, but most didn’t.

At the time, I considered it fun, but looking back now, I see that this incursion might have made a disservice to 2b2t by eliminating a chance of 2b2t to get more regular players from the IGN advertising. The few that decided to stay after being killed and persecuted at those times, remember those days with a bitter taste. I know this because some today are my friends. [This --&gt; [https://youtu.be/qun-6zB1zws?t=1m50s] Is an external link to the video in question that dropped Jun 20th 2013. I joined (Docsmurf) as the direct result of this video and was able to escape spawn and set up a temp base around 60K before the bulk of the Second incursion landed]

The only good act we did back there was defend NFE from newfag raids and potential griefers. ''Thousands'' of new players were killed according to estimates.

However, something good came up from this Incursion. It made possible the rebuilding of Valkyria by reuniting the crew again and even adding more people to it. The base wouldn’t shine again and become a legend without all the death and mayhem we caused at Spawn.

The Second Incursion was a necessary evil.&quot;

=== Groups Involved ===
* [[Valkyria]]
* IGN newfags

== Third Incursion ==
[[File:JIxTQKO converted.png|thumb|304x304px]]
'''The Wrath Incursion'''

'''Base of Origin: Asgard II, Rebellion, Frontline FOB.'''

'''Spawn Base: Volunteers Base, Wrath of Spawn.'''

'''Estimated duration: Exactly 1 month'''

The Third Incursion occurred during May of 2015. It started on the 29th of April, 2015, two years after the founding of Valkyria.

&quot;It’s not just for the base name. The third incursion was mainly motivated by anger and frustration. Asgard II was recently destroyed and most of the 30 members were caught by this feeling of hate. I knew that if I let this situation go unchecked, the members would scatter again like it happened at Belegost. So I called a new Incursion and took advantage of the Asgardian’s revolt and anger to fuel this new event. Before A2 was destroyed, calling a new incursion was something unthinkable to me, because of how senselessly violent the last one was. But If I had to call a new one to maintain the unity of our group, then I decided to organize it the best I could. I projected the Third Incursion to be an event less violent than the third and more creative and open to everyone. And it worked beautifully.

Thanks to 1.4.7 dupe stashes, all of the Asgardian received stacks of god apples while they forged their own equipment at FOB. Pyrobyte’s help in the construction of Wrath Outpost was absolutely vital. He alone made it possible for SIB to happen. My original plans for the base were much more humble and difficult. We also built monuments at spawn and rebuilt the core. We patrolled some spawn bases and killed players too, but a lot less than the previous one. The event also served as a place for people to work together. A opportunity for players to meet and collaborate, due everyone that decided to side with the incursion (with the exception of the KOS list) would be welcomed to work with us and help with any task. Great contributions from volunteers like Bammerbeast and Dorquemada surprised me a lot.
[[File:LX16qeI converted.png|thumb|220x220px]]
To me, I feel that the Third Incursion was a giant “Fuck You” to all the few that hate this group and mocked the destruction of A2. It was a huge and unexpected show of force and determination from the members involved at the very deep core of the server. It was also an open invitation for our enemies to show their faces, which they did… Most of them were killed countless times. Some had to face the indignity to run for their safety and combat log.

The Third Incursion surpassed my expectations, concluding as a successful event and making possible Asgard II rest in peace in our hearts and move on to new challenges.&quot;

This Incursion was also known for several exploits used, such as infinite blocks and mob spawning.

== Mini Incursion ==
'''The VICE Incursion'''

'''Base of Origin: N/A'''

'''Spawn Base: Most likely Valkyrian spawn bases and other forward operation bases'''

'''Estimated Duration:''' October, 2015 - ??? ''' '''

VICE's Mini Incursion was a small incursion that took place 7 months after the third incursion. When a person known as Andrew Paul posted an article titled &quot;the worst place in minecraft&quot; on motherboard.vice.com on October 5th, 2015, it brought a decent amount of attention to the server. This sparked a small amount of flooding to the server however was not as severe as the IGN article post, causing the 2nd Incursion, let alone the Rusher flood. The people from VICE were quickly dissipated from the server by the oldfags. Their was another article posted on the website rockpapershotgun.com

== Fourth Incursion ==
'''The Rusher Incursion'''

'''Base of Origin: Crystal Islands'''

'''Spawn Base: Several hidden forward operation bases, Moscow, and Baghdad'''

'''Estimated duration: July 24th, 2016 - September 1st, 2016'''
[[File:Download (1).jpg|thumb|220x220px]]
The Fourth Incursion was comparable in length to the Third Incursion. This Incursion was started by [[jared2013]] due to the Rusher invasion of the server when all other attempts by individual players to slow the flow of Rushers failed. At some point, jared2013 abandoned the server for one of his many short-term hiatuses and [[Sato86]] took the reigns of the Fourth Incursion for a period of time.

The Fourth Incursion is considered a separate entity from [[Team Veteran]], due to much of the rejection of [[Fit]]'s careless integration of newfags and his Youtube shilling. Suspicions, that were later found to be correct, of Fit collaborating with [[TheCampingRusher]] was also a contributing factor of keeping Fit at arm's length.

Despite what some think, Fit was not involved with Fourth Incursion activities, and only ever came on the Fourth Incursion discord to gain information about ongoing events he was not a part of or to advertise his videos.

During the Incursion, large amounts of Rushers were killed and several enemy bases were griefed by Team Veteran, [[The 4th Reich]], and the Fourth Incursion.

As time dragged on, spawn became deserted with no one left but those using End Crystals to suicide those who were dumb enough to stay in spawn. Eventually, there would be internal conflicts that resulted in the destruction of 2 bases including Baghdad and Medina. However no major amount of resources were lost on their part. The bases were for resting, repairing and food. With bed bombing and End Crystal bombings becoming the new norm, the Fourth Incursion changed their tactics accordingly and followed [[DemonElite119]]'s move in creating lag machines in order to disrupt any progress by newfags or Youtubers. Despite this, TheCampingRusher still kept playing on the server (despite the lag machines not allowing him to make a base), which essentially caused the Incursion to fail. However, not long after the 4th Incursion, Rusher left for the first time from 2b2t due to him losing ideas for his youtube series and the start of school.

== Fifth Incursion ==
'''The Meme Incursion (AKA The 11/11 Dupe Incursion)'''

'''Base of Origin: N/A'''

'''Spawn Base: 4th Reich Obsidian Forward Operation Base'''

'''Estimated duration: November 23rd, 2016 - December 11th, 2016'''
[[File:Hqdefault (1).jpg|thumb|196x196px]]
The &quot;Fifth Incursion&quot; was announced by [[jared2013]] on November 23rd, 2016 on the 2b2t subreddit. The Fifth Incursion was a coalition of [[The 4th Reich]], stragglers of the 4th Incursion, and some of the remaining oldfags and midfags that remained on the server despite the chaos during the [[The Rusher War]].

The initial goals for the incursion was to make an obsidian wall around spawn, level spawn, remove lava casts and all water within the 400x400 radius, and build an obsidian town in order to contain spawnfags in the region, now that the 1.11 update made escaping spawn easier. It was a balancing act. Later goals were added to make advances against [[The Vortex Coalition]] wherever possible and to hunt for the numerous dupe stashes that came about from the [[11/11 Dupe]]. However, as the Incursion went on, it was turning out to be more of a meme than an actual incursion. The fact that most people didn't take the incursion too seriously makes this a Meme Incursion if anything on the subreddit. 
[[File:Capture8.PNG|thumb|373x373px|5th Incursion Symbol]]
There has been some action throughout the &quot;Incursion&quot; however minimal. There have been the presence of numerous individuals (mostly new players looking to PvP) armed with enchanted weapons and in enchanted armor, however combat has been minimal. The incursion was relatively quiet, with most resources being put toward containment rather than combat.

There was progress in constructing the obsidian containment wall, however it had been slowed due to interference from [[Team Aurora]] and concerns about waves of French newfags thanks to [[AgentGB]] and his video which advertised the server. Eventually, construction was never completed due to the massive amounts of withers spawned on the wall by several players.

There has been a brief command structure problem, with jared2013's stash supposedly being discovered and griefed. Enraged, he took another hiatus. [[DemonElite119]] took command of tactical operations to keep the Fifth Incursion operational and in line with its goals, while Tim_Mcnukepants focused efforts on building the spawn base of the Fifth Incursion.

The 5th Incursion eventually failed and officially ended on December 11th, 2016. The reason for its failure was that jared2013 got bored of the Incursion, the spawn bombing did not happen because the [[The Blind Eye Clan|group]] behind the bombing has been disbanded and the wall project has failed after the walls got withered by various players. The only thing that was a slight success in the entire incursion was an obsidian base in which the 4th Reich built (supposed to be the obsidian town mentioned earlier however remained a forward operations base), however the location of this base was leaked and griefed heavily. Overall, the Incursion ended up a meme and had almost become a real incursion if AgentGB made a series on 2b2t if the community hadn't completely spammed the shit out of him with hate comments.
[[File:Nedat.PNG|thumb|317x317px]]
What has often been overlooked was DemonElite119's betrayal of the very incursion he sought to keep afloat. As Tim_McNukepants went rogue and was disregarding any tactical plans to properly quarantine spawn and was working essentially on his own with random newfags that he invited unilaterally alongside his 4th Reich companions, DemonElite119 eventually leaked the location of the Fifth Incursion Forward Operating Base to NedaT and her companions, as well as to Drewbookman. Drewbookman would go on to spam the coordinates to the base, while NedaT rallied her forces, and a third group also appeared looking to grief the base. DemonElite119 self admittedly stuck around and pretended to fight, while planting withers within the base and attempting to protect a couple of individuals he still saw to be loyal companions, such as _Henry_ and Sun_Wukon. His betrayal was suspected but never proven until DemonElite119 himself admitted to leaking the coordinates to the base.

=== Groups Involved ===
* [[The 4th Reich]]

== Sixth Incursion ==
'''The Ant Incursion'''
[[File:IncursionVI.jpeg|thumb|220x220px]]
'''Base of Origin: N/A'''

'''Spawn Base: [[Gulag Spawn Camps]] (not official)'''

'''Estimated duration: Apri 3rd 2018 - May 3rd 2018'''

The Sixth Incursion was started by [http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/Sato86 Sato] on April 3rd, 2018. It was confirmed that AntVenom would be making a video on 2b2t that day, set to release at 16:00 EST. At that time, [http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/AntVenom AntVenom], who has over 2 million subscribers, made a video called &quot;The Face of Minecraft Anarchy&quot; in which he explains the synopsis of what 2b2t is.In his video, he explains the good and bad sides of 2b2t, including a clear warning to his subscribers about the foul and toxic behavior of 2b2t players. 

Later that day, the 6th incursion began on the temp map, that was created because the new hardware was sometimes experiencing intense lag and [[Hausemaster]] wanted to port the map to new hardware yet again. A small End base was built by members of [http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/Spawn_Masons Spawn Masons], [http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/The_Emperium Emperium], Asylum, [[Don Fuer|Donfuer]], [http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/The_Vortex_Coalition VoCo], NJHI, [[The Fursecutioners|Fursecutioners]], [http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/Team_Veteran Team Veteran], and [http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/The_Soviets The Soviets] on the temp map.  A wave of  &quot;Ants&quot; or &quot;Antfags&quot; joined the temp map following the video's release and server player counts were seen as high as 350+. The leaders of the 8 groups mentioned earlier planned for the incursion.  

Back on the main map, the incursion fighting kicked into full gear. A few other groups decided to join in on the Incursion, such as the Imperialists. Members of the incursion decided to build an obsidian wall around 1k of spawn. The obisidan used to make the wall was obtained through slave labor camps at both nether and overworld (0,0) built by incursion members. New players would be captured and forced to mine obsidian, if they didn't comply they were killed. This was the first known time in server history where slave labor was used on a massive scale. The Great Obsidian Wall was named the largest community project ever completed in server history. 

But once the great wall of spawn was completed, many players who had previously been fighting alongside the rest of the incursion turned against it, and began to grief the wall with withers. The incursion continued to kill and enslave new players even while fighting the protect and repair the wall, up until the end of the incursion. 

14 million subscriber YouTuber PopularMMOs was also seen logging into the server during the incursion, he was killed at nether spawn by Virl. He claims he will not make a video on the server but is simply &quot;having fun.&quot; The Obsidian Wall project around 1k of spawn was completed on April 24th, 2018. This was one of the main goals of the incursion.

The incursion officially ended on May 3rd, 2018, one month after it started, players counts were going back to normal by the incursion's end. The Incursion was considered a success, even though the obsidian wall has not proven effective due to being rather easy to get through.

''&quot;Underneath that blanket there is technically a disorganized group of neutral people who avoid PvP and provide humanitarian services. These Neutral players are the ones that plant and maintain melon farms for starving players. They also can be seen around spawn trying to restore resources to the wasteland.&quot;''

&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;Spawn Infrastructure Group (SIG for short) is a group of players who work together to repair and improve infrastructure on 2b2t. They work on [[Highway]]s, both large and small, that are deemed active enough to be repaired. Work is also done on overworld infrastructure that is not specifically made for travel (for example [[The Southern Canal|the Southern Canal]]), outposts for new and old players alike to restock near [[Spawn|spawn]] and the 4 diagonal nether and overworld highways.

== Relations ==
SIG is a neutral group, thus doesn't get involved in political 2b2t issues. The group has one goal, and strides to accomplish everything possible in order to make 2b2t highway travel, spawn travel, and survival for all players easier.[[File:Mgzz8vrnqc101.png|thumb|SIG is known for spamming captioned images of maintain work on the [[2b2t subreddit]]]]

== Leadership ==

Staff ranks:

'''Moderator:''' Moderators keep the discord running smoothly 24/7. Moderators are added by the Council of Infrastructure via a vote, and they are promoted via a vote too.

'''Council of Infrastructure:''' The Council of Infrastructure all have an equal amount of power and control over SIG. The members of the Council of Infrastructure will vote on important matters, where the majority rules. If there is a tie vote, the Supreme Leader (coltsnid) will vote as a tie breaker.

'''Chief Councilor:''' Once every two weeks, the Council will vote on a Chief Councilor. The person elected will direct/manage the overall group for two weeks (with the help of other Councilors), and report directly to Coltsnid with any questions or concerns.

Certain Council members will have specific roles, such as Project Manager, Highway Manager, Recruitment Manager, etc. However, these roles may be given to more than one Council Member.
[[File:2018-07-02 15.05.54.png|thumb|269x269px|SIG is known for creating portals with signs to advertise the group.]]

== History ==
SIG was created on tNovember, 18th 2017. It's original purpose was to serve as an information hub. The same day, there was a post made on the [[Subreddit|subreddit]]. Over the next few days, SIG organised multiple spawn meetups that kick-started rapid growth for the group. SIG continued to monitor operations since then and has created big things on the server, the most notable being the 12.5k nether ring.

During the month of December, SIG started posting &quot;12 days of SIG memes&quot; on the 2b2t [[Subreddit|subreddit]] in order to gain attention and members. The posts got on top of the [[Subreddit|subreddit]] for the first few days until the moderators started removing SIG memes from the [[Subreddit|subreddit]].

Activity continued for a while until activity started to die down. On December 28th, 2017, [[The Vortex Coalition|VoCo]] acquired SIG and took over executive operations from that point onwards. There was a short-lasting burst of activity until activity started to degrade again. On February 2nd, 2018, Casterly took a three month break from 2b2t. In order to keep the group running, Casterly passed discord ownership to [[Coltsnid|coltsnid]] and gave the Operational Manager rank (the person who ran the group) to Adriano1804.

The Spawn Masons was a group started by [[Hermeticlock]]. The group's goal was to simply build and then destroy their creations. According to [[Fit]], they represent true anarchy, in which they understand that their bases will eventually be griefed so they blow them up when they are complete.

== Rules and Inner Workings of the Group ==
Recruitment is by Invitation only.

The SpawnMasons are made up of several different ranks, Initiate, Approved Initiate, SpawnMason, And Worshipful. 

New members of the SpawnMasons are Initiates until they are approved by the Application Committee. Here is their criteria for being made approved:

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; 90% of Current Application committee must vote (Rounded Up).
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; 7/10 of the votes must be in favor of adding the initiate (Rounded Up).
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Only one revote for an initiate within a one month period (Month starts once the revote has been taken).
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Votes will be done via emojis on a post made by a worshipful with these words. “(PlayerName) for initiate.”
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; The only emojis that will be accounted for are yes for yes, and no for no.
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Once a post by a worshipful has been made. All members within the application committee have 48 hours to vote until a screen shot is take and posted again in the chat as final say.
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; If the 90% quota is not met, the application committee will be given an extended 24 hours to  vote. If the 90% quota still ins’t reached. We will considerate it a no.

Once an Initiate is approved they are scheduled for initiation. Initiations take place at weekly meetings, in lodges built by fellow brothers. They make the lodge look pretty and you'll be able to explore what they've built. The initiation includes agreeing with the rule of not hurting any other Spawn Mason in any way. 

Every week a SpawnMason is assigned a date that they will build a lodge.

Once you become a SpawnMason there are several different paths to take. There are different base groups and committees focused on many different secret projects.

Eventually if you get to know everyone enough you can become a member of the 33rd degree, which is their version of a trusted rank.

Once trusted, you're eligible to be nominated for the Position of Worshipful. This is made by motion, seconds, and then approval by unanimous vote. Worshipfuls are the Admins of the group, and they run meetings and conduct initiations.

SpawnMason meetings are highly productive and of a business nature. Agendas are made and minutes are recorded at every meeting by the Lodge Secretary. (Currently Jumbo_Warrior)

== History ==
[[File:Smbanner.png|thumb|253x253px|[[Spawn Masons|Spawn Mason]] banner]]
After [[Hermeticlock]] left [[DonFuer]], he moved on to create &quot;[[World Famous Spawn Base|Hermeticlock's World Famous Spawn Base]]&quot;. The spawn base was witness to the third largest battle in 2b's history and was griefed multiple times. Eventually, while at the base, [[Hermeticlock|Hermetic]] came up with the idea to found the Spawn Masons and eventually started to recruit several members. Several remnants of [[the 4th Reich]] decided to join the group, which eventually attracted oldfags, midfags, and newfags alike such as [[Fit]] who eventually gained interest in the group after being a lone wolf since the end of [[The Rusher War]].

Spawn Masons have regular meetings at a lodge close to spawn. This is where new members get initiated and actions are discussed. Apart from this, most of them make bases together and are active at spawn. Most SpawnMasons are peaceful to other players, and the majority of them think PvP is a pointless endeavor. The SpawnMasons simply seek to enrich the playing experience of 2b2t for themselves.

When Fit and Alphacomputer raided Summermelon, they broke the rule of not hurting other Spawn Masons, as they killed Krobar and griefed a city that was the base of several Masons. After long internal discussions about what can be tolerated and what cannot, they were both kicked. There was no full consensus about this, and this event created some tensions within the group.

On August 6th, 2017, Hermeticlock posted on reddit the official Spawn Mason disbandment post. The reason for the disband was because multiple people began to leave the group, relations were getting to tense, and Herm did not want what he created to shrivel up and die.

However, only a month later the group was reformed by members that did not want to see the group disappear. The whole discord was restored, most people came back and the weekly meetings were continued.
[[File:Logo-0.png|thumb|220x220px|Spawn Mason Logo]]

== Relations ==
* The SpawnMasons have no official stance on any particular group. They mostly do their own thing and ignore everybody else.
* The Peacekeepers - The peacekeepers attempted to get into conflict with the masons with a few skirmishes at spawn. However, the masons completely ignored this hostility.
* Some anti-spawn mason [[fagtions]] were made but most did not last. They were also ignored by the masons.

== Trivia ==
* The Spawn Masons work in a similar fashion to a fraternity or brotherhood, calling their members fellow brothers. 
* The group has a meeting to induct new players into the group. The meeting is within a lodge in which they blow up when the meeting concludes.
* The meetings are ominous with track 13 playing during them. New members swear an oath to the Masons and wear enchanted black leather armor. When members are accepted fellow brothers say &quot;so mote it be&quot;, which is a reference to the fraternity known as the Freemasons.
* The Spawn Masons go to spawn once every week.
* Their &quot;tradition&quot; is to blow up their bases after completion, so outsiders can't say that they griefed a base of the Spawn Masons.

Squidtown, also known as Passietown, was a 2011 base inhabited by several famous players and a squid statue. It was griefed by [[luke2thebun]] in late December of 2011.

== History ==
Passie Town was founded by passie05 during the [[Forum Massacre Period]]. The base went on to boast many castles and the iconic Blooper. The base also had a spot where [[Facepunch Republic]] members had meetings. It is unknown when, but [[Popbob]] went on to join the base and built a large dome, in which he would build several others and would later become iconic. Popbob also used his backdoor abilities, such as adding a pig spawner.

The base was later griefed by Luke2thebun and tytoowns281, both [[4channers]], who attacked the Facepunch base. This grief was the one that caused popbob to become a loner and cause his major [[Backdoors|backdoor]] and reign of terror.

5 years later the base was later leaked to the public by PandaSauce during the events of the Rusher War. The base has seen more destruction, and even popbob's dome was griefed.

== Trivia ==
*During 2011/2012, 50k from spawn was considered very far, making this base the farthest base from spawn during its time.
*Originally, it was never called Passie Town and just Squid Base, or SquidPolice Town.
*The dome popbob made at the base was built completely by hand, without world-edit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1062">The [https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t/ 2b2t Subreddit] is a subreddit on [https://www.reddit.com reddit] (duh) where people who play on 2b2t (or at least know of it's existence) can submit 2b2t related content. Memes, Shitposting, and ''Drama ''relating to 2b2t are here. The 2builders2tools admin is speculated to be owned by [[Curtis]].

According to the [[queue]], the subreddit itself is one of the three official contacts of 2b2t (all owned by Hause (with the reddit being te only discrepancy)). The other two being 2b2t.org (which has been down for atleast 4 years) and 2b2t.org@gmail.com which is the server's email (where you can freely spam and shitpost Hause :DDD).
[[File:Capture-1495151322.PNG|thumb|220x220px]]The 2b2t subreddit admins are known to delete any post criticising or questioning [[Fit]] as well as banning users for posting them. This raises questions about admin abuse on the subreddit as well as confirming the theory that Fit is being used to bring more money to the server owners.

Suicide Bombing is a tactic on 2b2t in which people intentionally blow themselves up with weapons that can instantly kill any player. However, depending on the user, survival can be achieved if the user knows what they are doing. The method became popular when the Minecraft 1.9 update added the crafting recipe of the End Crystal. This method is more effective than actually fighting someone, but is also considered as a cheap tactic. Eventually, this method became the norm for combat on 2b2t as TPS on the server can cause for long and boring fights.

== Types of Suicide Bombing ==
[[File:BedBomber.jpg|thumb|174x174px|Real life illustration of a bed bomber]]
* '''Bed Bombing''' - This method uses beds in the nether or end to kill other players. Bed Bombing takes advantage of the game mechanic in which beds will explode in the Nether and the End to prevent players from setting their spawn there. The explosion produced is extremely powerful and can even one hit kill a player in full Protection 4 diamond armor. [[File:Maxresdefault (1).jpg|thumb|220x220px|Someone dying from an end crystal bombing]]
[[File:Mqdefault.jpg|thumb|220x220px]]
* '''End Crystal Bombing -''' This method uses End Crystals are to kill other players. Since the End Crystal can only be placed on Obsidian or Bedrock, the bomber needs to bring obsidian with him. This has become the most popular way to kill players. Many teams are using this method, but one of the most popular End Crystal Bombers are [[The 4th Reich]] . It is the more &quot;[[TOBE TOTE suc|expensive]] &quot; way of bombing as end crystals are difficult to craft and obsidian can be hard to obtain, however this does not mean that you will not find these types of bombings as they are common due to dupes. This tactic was used extremely often during [[the Rusher War]] , where players would disguise as nakeds to lure diamond armor players and blowing them up.

== Survival and Tactics ==
The End Crystal and bed explosion can kill a player with a full Protection 4 armor (if placed right), but can be survived if the player eats an Enchanted Golden Apple or wears Blast Protection 4 armor. The explosions can also be survived if the player is hiding behind some blocks or is a single block below the crystal or bed as the game has a strange mechanic where the player cannot be hit on the top of their body by an explosion but only the bottom.

As stated above, End Crystal/Bed bombing can be used for combat, usually by players with full god gear to fight opponents, by rapidly placing crystals and beds. However, the common tactic is to run around naked at spawn with a small amount of food with the weapon of choice until you find a victim to blow him and yourself up (unless you're one block under the specific bomb).

With the introduction of Totems of Undying in 1.11, it evened out the combat playing field because the totems allow unsuspecting opponents to have a chance to fight back the attacker as they are revived when killed if they have the totem in their off-hand.

== Users ==
* [[Babbaj]] - Babbaj was the first user of these types of [[bombings]] as he showed a video of himself blowing up several fully armored players with a single crystal at the end of a [[4th Incursion raid]] . This video made the tactic popular.
* [[4th Reich]] - The 4th Reich is known to have used this tactic in many encounters.
* [[Team Aurora]] - While not as much as the 4th Reich, Team Aurora members do use their fair share of the tactic
* Suicide Bombers - Suicide bombers are players that lurk around spawn who look for an unsuspecting victim to bomb, blowing themselves up in the process. Once this is achieved, the bomber runs to collect any loot they may have received from the fallen player. They are the reason that spawn has very dangerous these days, as well as the hundreds of withers.
* [[Flyinqq]] - Flyinqq was one of the most experienced Suicide Bombers, without the Suicide part, he used to bomb many armored opponents and live to tell the tale. In his Wiki you can see all of the well known players he has killed.

Later additions included [[Offtopia]], [[Willyroof]], [[CytotoxicTcell]], [[Drud14]], [[Krobar1]], and [[Todarac]].

== History ==
Summermelon was one of the most magnificent and largest bases on 2b2t. It was under construction for only 4 months before it was destroyed.

Sometime in May, Bigdon was invited to Summermelon and after a couple weeks, leaked the coords to Fit. On July 28th, 2017, [[Fit]] made a video on griefing Summermelon for &quot;revenge&quot;, with the help of [[Alphacomputer]] and three others. 

At the time, Fit and Alphacomputer were members of the [[Spawn Masons]]. However, contrary to popular belief, the grief was not executed (or even approved by) the Spawn Masons. It was Fit and Alphacomputer acting on their own. After the grief, Alphacomputer was voted out and Fit left, and they never came back (due partially to the fact that [[Krobar01]], one of the most accomplished builders at Summermelon, was in the Spawn Masons at the time as well).

After the town, most of the builders moved onto Offtopia's flagship base.

== Reason for Grief ==
The reason that Fit griefed Summermelon was officially because jddinger stated that he had the coords to [[Rocket Town]] (Fit's sky base). BigDon was at Rocket Town as well.

However, jddinger was not in fact a member of Summermellon. This means that the only people affected by Fit were the builders of Summermelon, who had nothing to do with Fit's sky base (such as Toshie, theloneloner, Drud14, Krobar01, and aaron_alvin).

It is very likely that the real reason for the grief was to get interesting content on Fit's channel and to further improve the image of Fit amongst Fitfags by portraying him as just.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4287">Super Weapons, also known as the 32K weapons for their enchantment levels being 32678, are powerful [[Hacked Items|hacked weapons]] that exist on 2b2t, originally created during the third [[Backdoors|backdoor]] of the server by [[the Tyranny]].
[[File:Ridealong feb28 6.jpg|thumb|220x220px|An original 32k sword]]

== History ==

=== First Weapons ===
The first super weapons were created in late 2015 by [[iTristan]] and [[Pyrobyte]] during the third [[Backdoors|backdoor]]. These weapons could have been anything, from pickaxes to swords, or even potions. What made them super weapons was their enchantment levels of 32767, meaning that they were insanely powerful. These weapons were also known to have level enchantment X (10 in roman numerals) for most of the extra enchants that really aren't helpful in overall use of the weapons.

These weapons would have extremely powerful effects, like knockback and punch levels powerful enough to either kick someone for flying or to instantly knock them into unloaded chunks; fortune and looting levels that could cause insane server lag due to the prodigious amount of items that would drop from blocks broken and mobs killed, potentially crashing the server altogether; thorns levels that would instantly kill anything that attacked the wearer; resistance levels that would render the wearer virtually invincible; flame and fire aspect levels that would make the target burn almost indefinitely; unbreaking enchantments that would lower the chance of an item losing a durability point when used down to almost zero, and more.

Overtime, these weapons eventually spread throughout the community through death, trade, and other means, which caused an [[The Arms Race|Arms Race]] amongst some of the more powerful players. Eventually, in early 2016, [[Hausemaster]] discovered the existence of the superweapons and cracked down on the Tyranny and their backdoor, eventually destroying most of the weapons by using a plugin to return them to normal levels. However, for some reason, some weapons were not affected by Hause's plugin, possibly because they were never observed during the period of time the plugin worked, and many of these still exist today, with one in particular being found behind the world border. There were also books that survived with +32000 enchants on them.

=== Resurgence ===
[[File:Capture32767.PNG|thumb|220x220px|New 32k weapon]]
In May of 2017, [[Kinorana]] abused his SSH key to summon &quot;Kino's Fierce Deity Sword&quot; and &quot;Nukkuh's Ebin Pickaxe by KinoGoods&quot;, which were 32k swords and 32k pickaxes respectively. Kinorana, along with Nukkuh, Jacktherippa, and [[AlphaComputer]] headed to Spawn to kill spawnfags. AlphaComputer allowed FitMC to hold a superweapon that night, and a few days later he allowed Fit to stream him and Alpha at spawn killing people. 

After 2b2t updated to the 1.12 update, the superweapons were seemingly patched. Although this seemed to be the case, AlphaComputer instakilled PooleSenpai (monaxide) the very night of the update. Two weeks later, AlphaComputer got a few more kills of PooleSenpai. It was assumed that because there were no more kills from a 32k weapon, they were considered officially dead, but it was thought to be very likely by many that they would come into existence once again at some point in the future.

=== Resurgence 2: alphacomputer's boogaloo ===
In june of 2018, alphacomputer discovered an exploit that would allow him to open shulker boxes containing 32k items and place them in his hotbar, without them being deleted by the plugin on the server that was supposed to do so. Since he, Fit, and a few other players had duped thousands of these shulker boxes the previous year, they now had access to all the 32k weapons they could ever need, and alphacomputer once again returned to spawn to kill players with these weapons.

Alphacomputer realized that these items were valuable enough to be worth real-life money, so he started selling them to other players, until eventually, every major group on the server had access to 32k weapons. This prompted speculation that a war in which the combatants battled each other with 32k weapons could occur.[[Category:Items]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9023">THEJudgeHolden is an oldfag on 2b2t and one of the most influental players in the server's history. TheJudgeHolden joined 2b2t a few weeks before April, 2011 with [[Offtopia|Offopia']]s alt account and eventually teamed up with him. He and several other players  were the first to make it to 1 million blocks from spawn. Judge has also made 2 well-known bases, being Old Town and Old City. He also has a 2b2t comic series, where he illustrates his adventures on 2b2t. His most famous comic is 1 Million, detailing the adventure of him and his friends as they travel to 1 million. His comic collection will be linked at the bottom.

== History ==
NOTE: This is written based off of an interpretation through read throughs of THEJudgeHoldens comics and also information provide elsewhere. The comic tends not to explain everything, meaning it won't hold your hand through the whole thing, so it was left to self-knowledge of the server and the events of the group in order to understand what is going on at certain points. The comics seem like they were only meant for those who knew Holden best, therefore if there is any wrong detail from the interpretation, it would be appreciated to fix them. There is also a few missing details at times. There is also NO TL;DR.

=== Beginning ===
Like any player on 2b, THEJudgeHolden started off at spawn on Offtopia's alt and went through the struggle of it. At the time, it was not as severely destroyed as it is now, with more stretches of land and less lavacasts. It was also infamously known for a high abundance of mobs, which Judge constantly had to fight off. During his journey to escape spawn, he also came across the [[Valley of Furnaces]]. 
[[File:Screenshot 2018-06-09 at 8.35.15 PM.png|thumb|220x220px|Judge finding the Valley of Furnaces]]
[[File:Screenshot 2018-06-09 at 8.49.07 PM.png|thumb|276x276px|Judge escaping the mob invested chunk]]

During a lot more struggles, such as surviving an attack on a shelter he was hiding at and getting through a chunk that kept spawning creepers and spiders, Judge finally encountered a shelter which he knew was a trap and was littered with tnt landmines. At this point the player corruption event occurred on the server where spawn and all player's inventories were corrupted and reset. Spawn generated different biomes on the original biomes and became odd in its appearance such as snowing in deserts and the oceans freezing over.

=== Old Town ===
[[File:Screenshot 2018-06-10 at 7.21.53 AM.png|thumb|220x220px|The player corruption event]]
Weeks later, Judge settled down to build [[Old Town]] in April, 2011 and built an inn, a pool and a few homes. He had heard that people were getting raided 100k out from spawn so he assumed it would be only a matter of time before he was greifed or robbed by &quot;the guy who leaves a single rose at the places he robs&quot;. Eventually he met up with [[Offtopia]], who wanted to create a [[The Judge's Group|group]]. Judge, despite thinking it was a bad idea on 2b, invited him to Old Town. He eventually got his THEJudgeHolden account from Offtopia. At about 150,000 blocks out the two were travelling to find a stash of diamonds and got lost. Offtopia decided that maybe they should head back to Town and Judge refused, so the two split off, Offtopia laughing that he was lost and was going to starve. Judge went through only to go through confusing tunnels and eventually fell to his death. It was at this point Offtopia met jdw99666 and Elecdrof. 
[[File:Screenshot 2018-06-10 at 9.25.29 AM.png|thumb|220x220px|Judge's confusion to elecdrof and jdw having diamond armor if they are noobs]]
Eventually the two settled in Old Town however, had major issues due to the amounts of hostile mobs in the area. At this point, Judge had the idea of creating a wall during a regular supply run. Few days later, Offtopia eventually invited jdw99666 and elecdrof from spawn to Old Town, both being newfags. The group proceeded to build the wall around Old Town in order to ward of the onslaught of mobs and to keep out unwanted visitors. Turns out that jdw and Elecdrof were better than Judge at Minecraft since they were already stacked with diamond gear, which he was surprised by.[[File:Screenshot 2018-06-10 at 9.32.00 AM.png|thumb|220x220px|Popbob, the friendliest player on 2b :D]]

On a supply run through the nether, Judge met up with Offtopia to recruit willyroof and marksman77, both friends of elecdrof, from Shitpit City. They returned to Old Town finding jdw and Elecdrof adding builds to Old Town. One of the new recruits wanted to build outside of the base and Judge said fine. Couple days later, bubbakennedy and square_digger were recruited. The recruit who built outside ran out of wood and so Judge went off on a supply run. During this, Old Town was unfortunately attacked by [[popbob]] and griefed. All the members at the base were killed. Judge returned to find the chaos and went to take on popbob. The comic depicted popbob with his signature &quot;barely visible arm&quot; because it was moving so fast. It was no use fighting popbob and Judge was eventually killed.
=== Ravenholm and Ravendel ===
[[File:Screenshot 2018-06-10 at 9.47.29 AM.png|thumb|220x220px|Judge barely escaping popbob who used speed hacks]]
At spawn Judge was attacked by several newfags but he managed to escape and killed some with a creeper explosion. He met back up with Offtopia and he already recruited some random guy who liked fire from spawn. The group went back to Old Town to salvage what they could. Judge recovered his things and diamonds. The fire guy disappeared and Offtopia had to make multiple trips back to recover items. They then went through a nether portal in Shitpit City after hiring another player, and went off to Ravenholm, a base on an island, where the rest of the group was. 
[[File:Screenshot 2018-06-10 at 9.53.35 AM.png|thumb|220x220px|Willyroof, jdw, and others greeting Judge's arrival at Ravendel]]
Few days later, Judge made a trip to spawn, met a guy in a batman skin, and helped some newfags out. On his trip back, he encountered jdw and who told him that him and elecdrof were headed to help the rest of the group build a new [[Ravendel|base]] and asked if he wanted to join them. Judge wanted to continue exploring on his own. During his journey, he encountered popbob once again and was chased by him. Judge narrowly managed to escape in the ocean. He encountered a player who was also ambushed by popbob and wanted to kill him. Judge decided to head off to join his friends at [[Ravendel]] rather than pursue and kill popbob.
[[File:Screenshot 2018-06-10 at 11.38.22 AM.png|thumb|220x220px|Offtopia at what appears to be the Crystal Islands]]A while later, Judge finally made it and remet with the group. The group took him to where the construction was and would start real construction the following day. Overnight, popbob once again found their base. Judge went off with jdw back to a private base he had, they also found it destroyed. So, instead they went to jdw's which was not griefed. Meanwhile, Offtopia was attacked at what appears to be like the Crystal Islands by popbob and his buds. They ruined that base too.  

=== 1 million ===
[[File:Screenshot 2018-06-10 at 10.59.27 AM.png|thumb|220x220px|Jdw's note]]
After staying at the private base for a while, jdw left a note for Judge and eventually left to meet the group at 1 million to make the famous [[1mil Town|1mil town]]. Judge began the insane trip to 1 million through the nether and managed to find a dead player's loot on the way. He made it there after a long journey and met up with group once again. To chrisleighton's dismay, Marksman had invited several people to the base with the reassurance that only a few would make it through the grueling trek to 1 million.            
[[File:Screenshot 2018-06-10 at 11.13.56 AM.png|thumb|220x220px|Judge's arrival at 1mil Town]]For the most part, the build was going great. The base had several stacks of TNT and diamond brought to it by the original members and invited players at the base. x0XP offered to bring a &quot;fuckton&quot;, according to marksman77, of diamonds to the base. Judge was originally untrustworthy of x0XP but he arrived the next day and brought the diamonds that he promised to bring. He acted normal for the first couple of days and after the other players told Judge there was nothing to be worried about, Judge soon began to be less paranoid even after the player was hit by an apparent &quot;creeper explosion&quot;. However, he took the precaution of hiding a stack of diamonds elsewhere. The day came when x0XP ended up insiding the base and blowing it up, confirming Judge's original suspicions. The group attempted to kill x0XP but he had hacks that surpassed theirs and was able to destroy the base further.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5614">TPS, short for Ticks Per Second, is a measure of how fast Minecraft mechanics such as redstone and farming run at. If a server's TPS is low, this causes what players call &quot;server lag&quot; which causes for normal functions of Minecraft to malfunction.

TPS should not be confused with FPS, Frames Per Second, which is the measure of how fast the player's computer is rendering the game of Minecraft entirely, while TPS is usually recognized as the FPS of a server, in which measures the speed of how fast the server renders Minecraft. 

== Relating to 2b2t ==
The TPS of 2b2t has always been terrible, even during its early years. There are two main reasons for this bad of TPS: server issues and players (this usually being the biggest reason).
[[File:S7ywHc-pPCvXw-bZxOyar 3O8pOz0unTTUHlhsDPPCU.png|thumb|220x220px]]

=== Server Issues ===
* Very old hardware (Running for over 7 years)
* Players joining
* VERY LARGE MAP (worth over +3500 GB's) 

=== Player Issues ===
* The use of [[Lag Machines|lag machines]]
* Generation of chunks (from little to extreme amounts through exploits)
* Doing things that normally lag Minecraft (i.e. using redstone, detonating TNT, creating cobblemonsters, etc.)
2b2t is usually at an average of 20 TPS and is usually considered a miracle if it is above it. At 20 TPS 2b is still playable and normal game function works perfectly fine. However, players can turn on lag machines or use some sort of exploit that can slowly drag down the TPS to even levels below 1 TPS. This causes many of the normal functions of Minecraft to lag extremely, making things like breaking blocks a pain in the neck without god tools. Even with god tools, low TPS can still be a bit annoying as breaking blocks will cause the phenomena known as a &quot;ghost block&quot; in which a block appears broken and players may go through it, but in reality it is still there and can cause the player to glitch out in it or not allow for block placement near it.

The low TPS may also cause the phenomena known as the &quot;rubber banding effect&quot; on players. This phenomena is caused when a player moves and then is randomly placed, at any given time, in a sort of limbo where players cannot interact with blocks before being launched back to where the player first began moving before the random occurrence. 

Low TPS can also cause chunks to stop loading properly. You might find a chunk that will not load, and if you try to enter it, you will slowly fall through the world, and will have to relog to get back to the surface. It is possible to fall millions of blocks into the void by doing this, as while the client believes it is falling into the void, the server believes to you to be on the surface, meaning you won't take void damage. 

In conditions of super low TPS, If you are generating new chunks, generated structures such as ponds and plants will generate much later than the actual terrain, meaning you might fall into a hole that opens up beneath you, or have a tree generate on top of you. 

Low TPS also reduces the response time and movement speed of mobs, and delays any damage they may take. While this has the advantage of making hostile mobs unable to follow players, it also makes passive mobs unable to follow players, even with leads, which makes moving them around pretty impossible. Plus, it takes forever to actually kill anything, passive or not. Damaging other players in PVP is more difficult for the same reasons. 

Low TPS also reduces the speed of the day and night cycle, as the server has trouble keeping up with the in-game time, and so the sun and the moon themselves can be seen rubberbanding in the sky. 

Sometimes TPS on the server is so bad that it can even render the server unplayable and can cause an uproar in chat with a torrent of messages complaining about the lag. The most extreme examples of low TPS (so far) occurred on the instances when [[TheCampingRusher]] joined the server after [[Fit]] defeated him in their duel, and on june 1st of 2017. In both cases, everyone turned on all their lag machines in order to prevent youtubers from being able to do anything. The TPS was so low that it was virtually impossible to even move, chunks would generally not even load, and the chat would sometimes not work. 

It is a well-known fact that the TPS tends to be lower when youtubers are online, even those native to the server such as Fit or [[Torogadude]], because players who aren't fond of those youtubers will turn on their lag machines in order to make it more difficult for them and their fans to do anything. Generally, the more hated (or feared) the youtuber, the more players turn on their lag machines and the lower the TPS. 

If the TPS hits 0, the server usually restarts and kicks everyone back to queue. 

== Player Reaction ==
Players on 2b have varying opinions on TPS. Some think that surviving the TPS of 2b2t is a rite of passage, and that only true players of 2b can withstand the annoyance of lag and continue to play through it. Others complain and joke about it, calling [[Hause]] a lazy sack of shit for not fixing the lag. Several oldfags claim that they have become used to the bad TPS and have accepted it to be a normal part of 2b2t, while several newfags complain in chat and call the server a slow piece of shit that is barely playable. Players of 2b usually joke about bad TPS being something that weeds out the worst players. All in all, bad TPS, as annoying as it may be, is a common phenomena on 2b2t, and TPS will continue to test the best and weed out the worst. [[Category:Game mechanics]]

[[File:Maxresdefault.jpg|thumb|280x280px|Aurora Banner]]
'''Team Aurora''' is a team that was started on September 1st, 2016, towards the end of the [[The Rusher War|Rusher War]]. The team was made by NedaT as she was kicked out from the [[Resistance]] because she ended up being a [[Team Veteran]] spy. The team is essentially composed of members who have been kicked out of other groups and defectors (ie: PandaMC (from [[The Peacekeepers|Peacekeepers]]), Neda T (from [[Resistance]]), and PvP_Comboz (from [[Resistance]])). During the Rusher war, the group was Pro-Veteran, but has since moved away from either side. 

== History ==
Neda T was kicked out from the Resistance on August 19th, 2016, due to her giving the coords to the [[Duplication Glitches|dupe]] base that was destroyed by the [[Team Veteran|Veterans]] during the [[Spawn Incursions|4th Incursion.]] She did not go and join Team Veteran after she was kicked out, but rather went solo for a while. She eventually decided to create Team Aurora on September 9th, 2016. Eventually she began recruiting people like Faroaman and Chloe2k15. She also accepted PandaMC, who was kicked out of the [[The Peacekeepers|Peacekeepers]], and invited her Resistance comrade PvP_Comboz. Aurora would not be the Aurora we know today if she had not invited Brayin, who everyone describes as &quot;everyone's favorite homo&quot;. Her group became very close to Team Veteran as Neda posted several videos with [[Fit]] in them and essentially became a &quot;Vet&quot; sub group. The team has also attacked Rushers during the Rusher War. Despite this, they continued to have a close relation with TheJadhya (who was, if not the most, fanatical Rusher ever). Eventually, due to criticism, TheJadhya moved his [[Guardian Rushers|Guardian Rusher]] sub group away from Team Aurora declaring themselves neutral with them as long as they don't attack Rushers.

== Post-War ==
During the waning days of the Rusher War, NedaT began to focus her team's attention on the [[The 4th Reich|4th Reich]] due to a grudge she had against them during her Resistance days. The two teams even fought with each other right in front of Fit during the &quot;Post-War party&quot; that Fit started. Her team played a major role in the [[The Three Way War|Three Way War]] against the 4th Reich and Peacekeepers. Since TheJadhya left to create his own group, he gained the freedom to be close to Team Aurora. Eventually, Team Aurora began opening their doors to new members, as they have originally were a private group, as the conflict increased. 

== Relations ==
* The 4th Reich - Team Aurora has been enemies with the Reich since they were founded in the last month of the Rusher War. The bitterness between the groups began when the 4th Reich were talking shit around and about Neda T (back then a Resistance member). Once Neda created Team Aurora, the bitterness continued and even escalated to the groups exchanging griefings. Once Team Veteran was put to rest, the 4th Reich began calling Team Aurora members newfags. The two groups are currently in a three way war including the Peacekeepers.
* The Peacekeepers- The two groups are currently enemies as Team Aurora attacked several Peacekeeper bases towards the end of the war. Team Aurora is now in a three way war between the Peacekeepers and [[The 4th Reich]]. However, there was an attempt at peace between them, the Peacekeepers, and The Blind Eye Clan (known then as Ragnarok) however the alliance failed as the 4th Reich intervened.
* [[Team Rusher]]- The two groups are technically enemies since Team Aurora is Pro-Veteran. Since the group formed at the end of the war, the only real conflict between the two groups was the Largest Battle of Spawn where Neda T persistently wanted to kill Rusher herself. Team Aurora has also contributed to some Rusher killings, only to be stopped by TheJadhya.
* Team Veteran- While technically not a sub group, Team Aurora can be considered a Team Veteran sub group of sorts during the course of the Rusher War. Its relation with Team Veteran is similar to the relation between Peacekeepers and Rushers. It was mainly the &quot;Rusher&quot; part of the group as the members are mainly newfaggots and players that joined due to Rusher. Neda T was a Veteran spy who insided the Resistance and moved on to create her own Pro-Veteran group.
* The Guardian Rushers- Team Aurora was neutral with the Guardian Rushers, despite some good relations with TheJadhya.
* [[The Blind Eye Clan]] - Team Aurora is currently neutral with the Blind Eye Clan. The clan declared neutrality with Team Aurora as a peace treaty between Team Aurora, the Peacekeepers, and themselves failed.
* [[The Vortex Coalition]] - Since the two groups really haven't interacted with each other, it is safe to say they are neutral with each other.
* The Fulcrum Force - Despite bieng a minor group, The Fulcrum Force has declared war on Team Aurora.
* [[Team Rainbow]] - Several months after Aurora slowly became dormant, Brayin decided to make a new team as a subsiduary to Team Aurora (this would become known as Team Rainbow). Nothing actually came from this group until December of 2017 when Brayin started to take it more seriously. 

== Notable Members  ==
* Neda T (Leader)

* PandaMC 
* Faroaman
* Chloe2k15
* PvP_Comboz
* Brayin
* Jonpue

== [[Team Rainbow]] ==
In August of 2017, one of Aurora's members (Brayin) decided to create a sub-group of Aurora alongside his friend, Da99thWolf. The team was formed so that Aurora could reach out to other players without having them be directly in Aurora. Rainbow's morals and ideals on 2b2t are very much the same as Aurora.[[Category:Factions]]

Team Coca Cola - a group originally created in early 2017 after two members of [[Team Malaria]] were banned. The two members followed to create the team along with another friend, the team consists of 40 members of which over 30 are active. [[Team Coca Cola]] builds, battles and memes the entire server. Team Coca Cola has over 10 active bases in each quadrant of the map. Team Coca Cola's known banner is displayed on the bottom right. Team Coca Cola consists of three ranks; member, trusted, and elite, elite being the most novel and member being for the new joining members. Team Coca Cola recruits any high level players interested in joining.    
[[File:Teamcocacola.png|thumb|314x314px]]

== History ==
The group was founded in early 2017 by TeamCocaCola, [[Crystalinqq]] , and [[Flyinqq]] , both former leaders of Team Malaria, who had a dispute with the third leader, over power and decided to branch off. The two former leaders, along with a player known as 0nger (TeamCocaCola), announced its official start on January 4th, 2017.  

The group first began as a spawn-fighting group joining forces with past enemies to gain power, the team had a big influx of high level players in February, 2017. Team Coca Cola continued to recruit, growing quickly. Team Coca Cola then progressed to abandon it's spawn fighting origins and members started to settle down across the map, all of the bases growing to become Coca-Cola bases.  

The Team Coca Cola banner was originally designed by Mauiboydmc and was chosen to be by the team, but it was edited to make it a black bottle, not brown as it was originally made, previously before the creation of the banner the team did not have a official banner.  

The group claims to be one of the first groups to release the [[Donkey Dupe]] to the general public (they also showed an ender chest dupe which worked for a short amount of time but it never gained momentum as it was patched after release).  

== Relations ==
* [[Team Pepsi]] - Team Pepsi is Team Coca Cola's current arch nemesis.
* [[The Emperium]] - Allied.
* Other Groups - Team Coca Cola is mainly neutral with all other groups unless fowl interaction takes place.

== Banner ==
The Team Coca Cola banner is a fairly complex one, requiring five layers. It is meant to resemble a bottle of Coca Cola. Making the banner requires 1 White Banner, 10 Ink Sac, 8 Bone Meal and 6 Red Dye. The recipe is shown below.
[[File:Cocacolabanner.png|centre|thumb|704x704px]]

== Trivia ==
* The name of Team Coca Cola was influenced by [[Team Pepsi]]. At first, the two did not have any relations but are now archenemies of each other and rightfully so as both companies, Coca Cola and Pepsi, are rival competitors in real life.
* [[Barrendome|BarrenDome]], a small 2b2t youtuber, is known to be on the team.

'''Team Malaria''' was a group whose goal was to be feared at spawn. The group split from [[Team Imperia]]

== History ==
Team Malaria started when members of Team Imperia, [[Flyinqq]] , [[Sextinq]] , and [[Crystalinqq]] , split off due to arguments with Imperia hierarchy some time in December, 2016. The group moved on to attack anyone at spawn. The group decided to attack [[VoCo|VoCo's]] [[Gamma Base]] when they managed to inside the base thanks to the help of [[CokeQueen360]] . Luckily, all valuables were retrieved before the grief. In retaliation, VoCo sent one of their members, [[Salamander]] , to pose as an insider and give coordinates to CokeQueen's dupe stash to members of Malaria. Salamander posed the coords as actual VoCo bases and so Team Malaria ended up griefing their own team member's base.

Eventually, stability in the group did not last long as Flyinqq and Crystalinqq had an argument with Sextinq and split off to create [[Team Coca Cola]] . Sextinq continued to lead the group until they were insided by [[RusherIsAutistic]] and a lot of their items were lost. The group eventually withered away as former members got bored, lost hope, and/or joined other teams and eventually disbanded sometime in February of 2017.

== Trivia ==
* Team Malaria was a democratized group where no action was taken without proper agreement between all the leaders and the highly ranked members.

* '''Team Malaria''' was also known as '''Team Disease, or Team Herpes''' for various reasons.

== Relations ==
* [[Imperia]] - Imperia are enemies with Team Malaria
* [[The 4th Reich]] - The relation with The 4th Reich is undecided.
* [[The Vortex Coalition]] -''' '''The Vortex Coalition are enemies with Team Malaria.

[[File:Pepsi-logo.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Team Pepsi Logo]]
Team Pepsi is a team of players who all have the Pepsi logo in their nametags, and capes viewable on Impact (first seen on Impact 3.0). Their goals are to meme and conquer 2b2t. The only evidence of their existence is the Pepsi logo on the nametags and the Pepsi capes that are on some of the players, and view-able in Impact. [http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/2pork2bot 2pork2bot] can be seen spreading Team Pepsi propaganda in the 2b2t in-game chat.[[File:126l1m3b8m1y.png|thumb|220x220px]][[File:Minecraft banner g5Bgq29g8gvgog3.png|thumb|218x218px|Team Pepsi Banner and Cape Design]]

== Relations ==
* [[Team Mentos]] - Team Pepsi is enemies with Team Mentos.
* [[Team Coca Cola|Team Coca-Cola]] - Team Pepsi is archenemies with Team Coca Cola.

== Banner ==
The Team Pepsi banner design is a complex one using all six available layers on a blue backround. It is obviously meant to represent the Pepsi logo. Crafting it requires one Blue Banner, 18 Bone Meal, 3 Red Dye and one Vine. The crafting recipe is shown below.
[[File:Teampepsibanner.png|centre|thumb|776x776px]]

== Discords ==
Sometime in December 2016 some players(founding members) created a discord under the name #teampepsi and slowly started expanding until it became one of the most active 2b2t discords in 2017 but after alot of turmoil and arguments and several doxxes being released the discord was deleted on June 1st of 2017 but not all hope was lost because soon after Pepsi Boy created another Team Pepsi discord which exists to this day.

|}'''Team Rainbow''' is a team that was founded by Brayin on August 11, 2017 after [http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/Team_Aurora Team Aurora] slowly 
became dormant (but has not yet disbanded). Brayin wanted to continue to play on 2b2t even though his team had mostly moved on to other things (like an Aurora SMP). The first two members to join were '''Da99thWolf''' and '''TheEnderBomber ''' (both former members of [http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/The_Peacekeepers the Peacekeepers]) and it remained the three of them until December 17, 2017 when Brayin made a [https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t/comments/7keii8/introducing_team_rainbow/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link Reddit post] announcing that the team would indeed become a more serious thing and that they were currently recruiting new members.

As of May of 2018, Team Rainbow has become one of the largest groups on 2b2t. They are responsible for many rainbow- themed builds which have been popping up in the greater spawn area. 

==History==
 '''Brayin''' and '''Da99thWolf''' started playing regularly on 2b2t around the same time and became friends over their YouTube channels where they would play around with the idea of making videos on &quot;The Oldest Server in Minecraft.&quot; Eventually, Brayin made friends with [[NedaT]] and was invited to join [[Team Aurora]]. Da99thWolf befriended a girl by the name of EmeraldGirlYT and moved her way into [http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/The_Peacekeepers the Peacekeepers] originally to spy on them and give the coordinates to Aurora. On October 3, 2016, Da99thWolf brought [[CancerChan]] to [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boz-wlEMVc0 Nightingale] and accidentally destroyed it, making Brayin a little weary of Da99thWolf's intentions in their friendship. Eventually they both moved up the social heirarchy of their respective teams and went their seperate ways until the teams became dormant and the two rekindled their friendship. Thus, Team Rainbow was born and TheEnderBomber was added to the crew (on August 11, 2017) along with some other players of the Anarchy server. Two months later, in December of 2017, Brayin began to recruit new members for the team as 2b2t entered a quiet period. Originally, he wanted to do this with Aurora, but did not want to do it without NedaT.

In January of 2018, a secondary banner was created for new recruits of the team since the interest had increased by quite a lot. Team Rainbow began to hang out more at Ocelot Bay due to Brayin's obsession with cats. They are frequently there repairing builds and taming the Ocelots that seemingly only spawn there. 

April 3, 2018 brought a new wave of 2b2t players to the server and Team Rainbow began to scout out the best of the bunch to join the crew whilst simultaneously helping kill new players at spawn. This did not mean they were 100% against the incursion in any way, but simply doing their own thing in order to benefit their group in the long run.   

As Summer of 2018 was approaching, Team Rainbow became more active around the spawn area and further bonded with fellow group, [http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/Infrared Infrared]. Brayin and Retronautx (leaders of Rainbow and Infrared respectively), decided that it would be a good idea to befriend newbie, FloatTea and become allies with her brand new group: Team Netherteas.  
==Post- Rusher War==
Some time after [[The Three Way Conflict|the Three Way War]], the Peacekeepers became highly inactive and the 4th Reich &quot;disbanded&quot; loosely, leaving Aurora as the only team left for several months until it too became inactive. Seeing as Aurora and the PK were allied with the Blind Eye Clan for a short period of time and that Da99thWolf had already had a friendship with Brayin in the past, they started a team together.

== Team Aurora ==
[[Team Aurora]] was originally the only group for Brayin and NedaT. Aurora is still very active and looking for chill people to accept into the group. Team Rainbow can be classified as an extension of Team Aurora, seeing as if they see fit, a Rainbow member can be promoted to Aurora status. With this being said, Rainbow is also very much responsible for its own actions.

==Relations==
*[[Team Aurora]] - a team formed by NedaT which Brayin is a part of, despite the inactivity.
*[[The Peacekeepers]] - a team formed by PandaSauceYT. It is unknown the current status of Da99thWolf in the team although at one point she was co-owner alongside EmeraldGirlYT when PandaSauceYT quit 2b2t for a period of time. As of April of 2018, Peacekeepers are friendly with Team Rainbow!
*[[The Blind Eye Clan]] (formerly Ragnarok) - Brayin and Da99thWolf were both involved with the Triple Treaty (TTT). In December of 2017, Flip began to show his support to Team Rainbow
*[[The 4th Reich]] - iTavux helped to make Brayin and NedaT better friends, which lead to Brayin joining Aurora. The 4th Reich would periodically meme Brayin and Da99thWolf at one point in time because they did not take them for serious players.
*[[The Vortex Coalition]] - Since the two groups really haven't interacted with each other, it is safe to say they are neutral with each other.
*[[Highland]] - NedaT has introduced Brayin to the members of Highland and they appear to be neutral to Team Rainbow
*[http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/Infrared Inferno] - As of December 20, 2017, Team Rainbow is officially allied with Team Inferno!
*The Menders - The group of R2bEEaton is allied with Team Rainbow.
*[[Trojan]] - Enemies due to an alliance with Infrared

==Trivia==
*Contrary to popular belief, Team Rainbow is a proud supporter of the LGBT community, although members may do what they wish with their personal lives. The team name also comes from the peacefulness that the Rainbow represents without being peaceful at all times (ex. the Hurricane BEFORE the Rainbow). 
*The team is an open group, but is in fact open to accepting ants regardless of their background (ex. an enemy to Aurora or PK may or may not be eligible for acceptance into Team Rainbow).
*The recipe for the Team Rainbow banner can be found [https://www.needcoolshoes.com/banner?=labEmLffkwaiaB here].
*There is a secondary Team Rainbow banner, designed for elite, higher class members. That can be found [https://www.needcoolshoes.com/banner?=labEmLffkwpipB here].
*Brayin and Retronautx are faggots.

'''Team Rusher''' was a large group on 2b2t. It is largely decentralized, but [[TheCampingRusher]] is generally recognized as their leader. Their main goal was to defeat Team Veteran and earn their spot on the server, but they wished to do so without destroying any of the server's monuments. Team Rusher was one of the main groups during [[The Rusher War]].

The term Rusher is often ambiguous: it is referred to as a team and as a collective term for people who were led to 2b2t by TheCampingRusher. Some regulars of the server solved this, however, and started calling them Junefags.

==History==
[[File:RusherFlag-0.PNG|thumb|220x220px|Rusher Flag]]
Team Rusher was established when hundreds of people attempted to join 2b2t after [[TheCampingRusher]] released his first 2b2t video on June 1st, 2016. Several pre-June players began slaughtering them at spawn, and created several obstacles for new players when escaping spawn. Despite the efforts of pre-June players, a few Rushers escaped spawn and began fighting back, saying they deserve a place in 2b2t. Even though TheCampingRusher remained hesitant to grief, many Rushers who escaped spawn began griefing famous monuments, much to the frustration of the Veterans. TheCampingRusher, noticing the Veterans'

frustration towards his fans, declared war on them, starting what is now called, [[The Rusher War|The Rusher War.]] In the early stages of the War, Rushers were slaughtered, and in the mid-stages of the War, the 4th Incursion was announced, causing more Rusher casualties. Few Rushers had the materials, or capability to fight back to the Veterans with great advantages. Later, some powerful Rushers created The Resistance, a group that claimed to be independent from Team Rusher. Resistance members succeeded in killing a number of Veterans, but their efforts were in vain, as less powerful Rushers were decimated, and Resistance bases and dupe stashes were destroyed. The rusher made group known as the peacekeepers, originally meant as a neutral/peacekeeping group that would fight both sides to stop the war, was eventually influenced by Napkin0fTruth, Rusher’s faction buddy, to fight for Team Rusher. However, unlike the Resistance, the group surprisingly stayed active for about a year later after the war, remaining one of the last pro-Rusher groups post war. Many say Team Rusher lost the War on October 9th, 2016, the date when Fit declared the War over, however, due to the controversy of the entire war, it is up for debate.

== Relations ==
* [[Team Veteran]] - Team Veteran was the sworn enemy of Team Rusher as the Veterans of the server did not like the massive popularity the server was receiving and swore to slaughter every last Rusher and track down TheCampingRusher.
* [[Resistance]] - The relation with Team Resistance throughout the war was very &quot;shaky&quot; between the two according to Rusher. The teams would flip flop between being allies, to neutral, to even enemies during the Largest Battle of Spawn, in which CorruptedUnicorn fought against Rusher with FitMC due to Fit inviting Corrupted to fight with him before Rusher and also to take revenge for a dispute between Napkin0fTruth and GoDzOneManArmy. However, throughout the entirety of the war, both did share common enemies and can be considered Pro-Rusher in values.
* [[Peacekeepers]] (Previously known as Team Equinox(Neutrality)) - The relation between Team Rusher and Peacekeepers was very strong. The main reason for this is because Rusher's friend and factions rival, Napkin0fTruth, joined the Peacekeepers. Napkin has claimed that the good relation of the group with Team Veteran and Team Rusher was 90% with Team Rusher and 10% with Team Veteran, which technically made it a Rusher sub group, despite its original idea of stopping the fighting between the two major groups.
* Guardian Rushers - the Guardian Rushers were a sub group of Team Rusher lead by TheJadhya, acting as sort of a diplomatic group, composed of stronger Team Rusher members which aided the much weaker ones at spawn. Despite TheJadhya's attempts to call Rusher's attention, Team Rusher as a whole did not really care about the Guardian Rushers although TheJadhya has worked with WildX and LandonMC.
* [[Team Aurora]] - The two groups are technically enemies since Team Aurora is Pro-Veteran. Since the group formed at the end of the war, the only real conflict between the two groups was the Largest Battle of Spawn where Neda T persistently wanted to kill Rusher herself.
* [http://2b2t.wikia.com/wiki/The_Vortex_Coalition The Vortex Coalition] - At first The Vortex Coalition stood with the old players as [http://2b2t.wikia.com/wiki/The_Rusher_War The Rusher War] began, but later they declared themselves neutral and began accepting new players into their ranks.
* [http://2b2t.wikia.com/wiki/The_4th_Reich The 4th Reich] - Despite The 4th Reich being comprised of new players who joined after TheCampingRusher, they are enemies of Team Rusher and multiple members have worked with Team Veteran in several Anti-Rusher operations. They also have been present in many of the major battles during the war and contributed to the Rusher Massacre of Spawn and the 4th Incursion.

== Post-War ==
When the Rusher War began to slow down at the end of the summer of 2016, Rusher left for about a month without any activity on the server which lead FitMC to declare the war over on October 9th. TheJadyha began to claim that he was taking Rusher's place as leader of Team Rusher. However, many were not happy with this (especially because he was interacting with Team Aurora, who are a Pro-Veteran group) and so TheJadyha stepped down and decided to leave the group in order to create his own. Rusher then returned and began posting videos once again, however he kept telling his viewers that these videos could be the last. His presumed final video was on October 22nd which marks the official end of the Rusher Period. Team Rusher is still somewhat present as Rushers still roam the server however it is highly unorganized and more of a classification rather than an actual group. Many Rushers have moved on to become much more powerful players on the server and are now scattered throughout the server.

Overtime, the queue has started to go down and it has now reached below 150 in population. Several Rushers by this point have either joined other groups or made a name for themselves and have totally moved on from the Rusher fiasco. The fanatic Rushers who are dedicated to Team Rusher are in the minority (that's if they even continue to play on the server).

== Pocket Edition Influence ==
The Team Rusher influence not only spread through the PC version of Minecraft but to the PE version of Minecraft on the server 2b2t.pocketmine.live during the war. A small group formed on the server and was lead CreeperGriefer3. They lacked in numbers, but they made up for it in alliances. The Rushers were allied with The Resistance and other small groups on the Pocket edition server. This team raided several bases but are probably disbanded by this point as Team Rusher is disbanded on PC.  

== Banner ==
The Team Rusher banner consists of 3 layers on top of a white banner. Crafting it requires 1 White Banner, 1 Oxeye Daisy, 1 Ink Sac, 5 Grey Dye and 5 Bone Meal. The banner is crafted as shown below.[[File:Rusherbanner.png|centre|thumb|792x792px]]

==Notable Members==
*TheCampingRusher (Team Rusher leader and founder)
*MrMitch361 (Co-founder)
*UnstoppableRageTrain
*BenMascott
*NobleThread
*Graser10
*TheJadyha
*Napkin0fTruth (speculative)
*iTzFreezy__
*LandonMC
*NoBoom
*WildX
*CurtPvP
*KingPenguin
*FormidableSheep

The exact number of Rushers is unknown, but is likely in the hundreds.

== Trivia ==
* The term Rusher is similar to the term Facepuncher used during the [[The Facepunch War|4chan-Facepunch War]], because it was used to generalize a group of players and not necessarily mean they were close to Rusher, but just to refer to them that they came from TheCampingRusher. It is also often misused, since some newfags could be led to 2b2t by FitMC and not Rusher.
* &lt;span&gt;During the early days of the war, some Rushers were called Mookiefags as &quot;the Mookies&quot; are fans of MrMitch361. This term was eventually no longer used as the Mookies were infused in the Rusher population and were simply considered Rushers.&lt;/span&gt;
* &lt;span&gt;&quot;Rusher&quot; is sometimes used as a generic term for all new players by the Veterans, but many intended to remain neutral or join other groups.&lt;/span&gt;
* Many “[[factions]]” were created by the members of Team Rusher due to the heavy influence of faction server mentality, provided by Rusher’s Minecraft Youtube background

'''Team Uberslugcake''' was a group created by Uberslugcake with the goal of repairing spawn. They recruited new players to help them in exchange for food. They also used the motto &quot;DEDICATION MOTIVATION ACCELERATION.&quot; During the April backdoor, all of the team's bases were found and destroyed, causing the members to rage quit. Uberslugcake has been meming on the reddit, so the team could still be around.

== Information From Uberslugcake himself ==
This was taken from [http://www.jamesrustles.com/2016/07/a-complete-history-of-team-uberslugcake.html www.jamesrustles.com] and was posted by Uberslugcake. 

THE BEGINNING



I UBERLUGCAKE JOINED THE SERVER IN THE LATE 2013S AND TREKKED AROUND SPAWN GATHERING FOLLOWERS. I WAS FILLED WITH CONTEMPTMENT AS I OBSERVED THE LANDSCAPE AROUND ME. &quot;HOW COULD ANYONE LET THE SPAWN FALL INTO SUCH DISREPAIR&quot; I THOUGHT TO MYSELF. I SHOOK MY HEAD AND SHOOK MY HEAD UNTIL IT WOULD NOT SHAKE ANY LONGER AND I REALIZED I HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. I ESCAPED SPAWN THAT VERY LIFE WITHOUT DYING IN THE TURMOIL OF SPAWN AGAIN. I ESCAPED AND CREATED THE FIRST UBER BASE™.

AT THIS BASE I ESTABLISHED THE MANTRA DEDICATION MOTIVATION ACCELERATION AS WELL AS RECRUITING TEAM UBERSLUGCAKE™ MEMBERS. AS THE GROUP GREW MY TRUST OF THE NEW RECRUITS GREW AS WELL WE WERE A FORMIDABLE CREW AND COULD NOT BE STOPPED. I RECRUITED ONLY NEWFAGS AS THEY HAD THE SAME GOALS AS I, TO RETURN SPAWN TO ITS PAST GLORY. I HAD HEARD OF WHEN THE SERVER FIRST BEGAN AND ALL OF 2B2T LIVED AT SPAWN TOGETHER IN ONE BIG PEACEFUL COMMUNITY AND I WANTED IT TO RETURN TO ITS GLORY DAYS. I SENT MY RECRUITS OFF TO ESTABLISH UBER BASES™ OF THEIR OWN.

THE EXPANSION



I UBERSLUGCAKE GATHERED MY THINGS FROM THE ORIGINAL [[Uber Bases|UBER BASE™]] AND HEADED INTO THE NETHER HIGHWAY TO ESTABLISH THE MOST PERMANENT OF UBER BASES™. I KNEW THAT I HAD TO ESTABLISH A STRONG STABLE BASE OUT IN THE HIGH COORD REGION SO THE TEAM WOULD HAVE SOME KIND OF FOOTING TO REBUILD SPAWN. WHILE MY MEN GATHERED RESOURCES AT THE UBER BASES™ NEAR SPAWN PREPARING FOR THE REBUILD THAT WAS SO FAR AT THIS POINT I VENTURED FAR INTO THE HEART OF 2B2T NOT KNOWING WHAT TO EXPECT. IN THIS PERIOD THERE WAS ANY WHERE FROM 10-15 NEWFAG RECRUITS OUT BUILDING BASES.

THE SETTLING



I UBERSLUGCAKE FINALLY HAD ARRIVED AT THE COORDS THAT I FELT WERE APPROPRIATE TO SET UP THE OFFICIAL UBER BASE™. THIS BASE WOULD BE THE MAIN HUB OF ALL UBER BASES™ ON 2B2T AND WHERE ALL OF THE POWER WOULD BE HELD I HAD TO BUILD IT WITH MEANING AND WITH PRIDE. ALL OF MY RECRUITS WERE FILLED WITH DEDICATION MOTIVATION ACCELERATION AS WE PREPARED FOR THE REBUILD SHOUTING OUT TO THE WORLD &quot;DEDICATION MOTIVATION ACCELERATION&quot; THERE WOULD BE THOSE WHO DEFIED US BUT WE KNEW WE WOULD PREVAIL. NO OLDFAGS ON THE SERVER WOULD BELIEVE WHAT WE HAD ACCOMPLISHED AT THE TIME BUT THAT DIDN'T MATTER TO US NO WE HAD EACH OTHER AND KNEW WE WOULD PREVAIL.

THE REBUILD



I UBERSLUGCAKE AND MY RECRUITS HAD EVERYTHING READY WE WERE GOING TO REBUILD SPAWN AND ALL WE NEEDED WAS DEDICATION MOTIVATION ACCELERATION. WE WERE ON OUR WAY TO SPAWN WITH ALL OF OUR RESOURCES AND WE REBUILT FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS BUILDING MELLON FARMS AND DESTROYING LAVA CASTS. NOTHING COULD STOP US WE WERE THE PERFECT TEAM™. WE REBUILT SPAWN AS BEST WE COULD FOR AS LONG AS WE COULD BUT LITTLE DID WE KNOW THAT OUR REBUILD WAS ABOUT TO END A LOT SOONER THAN WE HAD HOPED.



THE END



I UBERSLUGCAKE BECAME INCREASINGLY WORRIED APPROACHING APRIL 2016 THINGS DID NOT ADD UP ON THE SERVER ANYMORE. IT SEEMED THE SPIRIT OF HAUSEMASTER AS WE KNEW HIM AT LEFT COMPLETELY. I BEGAN CONSULTING WITH THE OLDFAG I KNEW ON THE SERVER AND HAD DISCOVERED A HORRIBLE SECRET THE SERVER HAD BEEN BACKDOORED HARD. I KNEW I HAD TO DO SOMETHING TO STOP THIS IT WAS THE TEAM UBERSLUGCAKE™ WAY BUT BEFORE I KNEW IT ALL OF OUR BASES HAD BEEN DESTROYED AND WERE NO MORE. THE BACKDOOR CREW™ HAD FOUND ALL OF OUR COORDS THROUGH THE EXPLOITS AND DESTROYED THEM IN OUR SLEEP. WE HAD NO WHERE ELSE TO TURN SO WE HAD TO LEAVE 2B2T FOREVER AND HOPE THAT ONE DAY SOMEONE WOULD DEFEAT THE BACKDOOR CREW™ SO WE COULD RETURN TO OUR BELOVED HOME IN PEACE ONE DAY.

== Uber Bases ==
Uber Bases were spawn bases made by[[ Team Uberslugcake]] in order to make progress on their attempt to fix [[spawn]] . Many, if not all bases, were griefed due to their closeness to spawn.

Team Veteran is a movement whose goal is to eradicate famous YouTubers who have large fanbases in order to decrease the amount of fans flooding the server and the mass destruction that sporadic newfags could cause. They do this by conducting mass killings of the fans and hunting the specific YouTuber constantly. The group was formed in June of 2016 in order stop the invasion of [[TheCampingRusher]] fans on the server. The members before the assembly of Team Veteran were called &quot;OGs&quot; by Rusher and veterans afterwards.

Team Veteran is one of the two main belligerents in [[The Rusher War]], the other being [[Team Rusher]].

It should be noted that Team Veteran and the Fourth Incursion are two separate entities, despite some overlapping members and goals, as well as Team Veteran being more of a movement, an idea, a meme, and a community initiative, rather than an actual &quot;team&quot; or “faction”.
[[File:KQp3Rbp.png|thumb|220x220px|Veteran Flag]]

== History ==
Team Veteran was started on June 16, 2016 by the player [[Fit]] as a means of defending against the imposing Rusher invasion by a famous youtuber known as [[TheCampingRusher]], in the summer of 2016. While still in its infancy, Team Veteran was regarded by Oldfaggots as a valid method of destroying the Rushers. However, as Fit's channel grew, Rushers began to &quot;join&quot; Team Veteran, which made several Oldfaggots turn against it. Before the official video, Fit made a video that would launch his YouTube career. He made a video about slaughtering a base of Rushers on the temporary map of 2016, along with Babbaj and jared2013. This video would later become recognized as the video that started the war. By the time Newmape 2016 had ended, Fit had a fanbase of over 25,000 subscribers. With this, he forced Team Veteran upon his subscribers to create a formidable opposition to Team Rusher. Throughout the war, many Oldfags and Midfags participated on the side of Team Veteran.

On October 9th, 2016, Fit officially put Team Veteran to rest as the Rusher War was officially over and the Rusher Era was about to end. However, Fit declared a call to arms on November 25th, 2016, and reawoke Team Veteran as a French youtuber known as AgentGB, a youtuber with 600k subscribers, posted a video about the server. Fit ordered the killing of any player who speaks french on the server. However, AgentGB never made another video. The group was also put on watch for the Spanish crisis when ElRichMC joined the server. Another time Fit called members Team Veteran back together was to grief Viper Base, a base made by Offtopia, however most say it was just for the money on Fit's YouTube channel. The most recent reawakening of Team Veteran was during the 6th Incursion to wipe out the Antfags that were joining server due to AntVenom’s video.

=== Controversies ===
As mentioned earlier, several oldfags disliked Team Veteran due to their inclusion of newfags. However, according to Sato86, Fit intentionally did this to create a ruse. The idea was, by making war propaganda videos for Team Veteran, newfags would be under the impression that they were helping Team Veteran in the “war”. Sato's point was to use the newfags that were in Team Veteran to regain territory on the temp mape as they were losing ground. Once temp mape ended, oldfags, independent, and midfag Team Veteran members alike, would begin to slaughter all newfags, no matter their banner. Fit's apparent ruse was to cause the Rusherfags to turn against each other, causing distrust and less team formation. Oldfags did not care what banner the newfags had so they were all slaughtered.

Whether this was true or not was unknown at the time, however many people probably looked at this as a cover up from Sato that they kept newfags in the group as no oldfag, Veteran or independent, showed a video where they attacked a rusherfag with a Veteran Banner. Sato has said that not all oldfags were in this ruse during temp mape. This may have also been a cover up for the long belief that the group was actually a meme and was used to encourage the war, meaning the group actually welcomed newfags.

As stated, many believed during the war and afterwards that Team Veteran's was founded in order to encourage the war and make it a publicity stunt, rather than solely being out to erradicate the Rusher threat. This also caused oldfags and midfags to move away from Team Veteran as the group wasn't truly out to hate Rushers. Post war, Veteran leadership later implicated or blatantly confirmed this as without the war and the publicity it brought, the server may not have recovered from the 2015 backdoor crisis before the war. Whether or not the group was simply always a meme, it cannot be denied that people had a general dislike for the rusher floods and that many were massacred and followed the original intention of Team Veteran to get the rushers off the server.

At this point, Team Veteran is really just pseudo group that fitfags and others join in order to fight newfag invasions and really is considered a meme.

== Relation ==
* [[Team Rusher]] - The main enemy of Team Veteran.
* [[Peacekeepers]] - Team Veteran is enemies with the Peacekeepers as they are a Pro-Rusher group and could be called a Rusher sub group due to their close relations with Team Rusher. They also hate the Peacekeepers because of Napkin0fTruth who betrayed Team Veteran to join the Peacekeepers.
* [[Resistance]] - Team Veteran is enemies with the Resistance as the Resistance griefed the Valley of Wheat and were a Pro-Rusher/Anti-Veteran group. The two teams had many skirmishes with each other during the Rusher War and one of the Resistance's dupe bases was griefed by Team Veteran during the 4th Incursion. During the Biggest Battle in 2b2t History, the two teams had a temporary truce and teamed up against Rusher.

* [[Team Aurora]] - While technically not a sub group, the group can be considered a Team Veteran sub group of sorts during the course of the Rusher War. Its relation with Team Veteran is similar to the relation between Peacekeepers and Rushers. It was mainly the &quot;Rusher&quot; part of the group as the members are mainly newfaggots and players that joined due to Rusher. Neda T, their leader, was a Veteran spy who insided the Resistance and moved on to create her own Pro-Veteran group. The group is now in somewhat of a civil war with the 4th Reich.
* [[The 4th Reich]] - Despite being comprised of new players who joined after TheCampingRusher, they have worked with Team Veteran in several Anti-Rusher operations. They also have been present in many of the major battles during the war and contributed to the Rusher Massacre of Spawn and the 4th Incursion. The relation between the 4th Reich and the Veterans was very strong and the Reich could be considered a sub group of Team Veteran during the Rusher War. Some oldfags have worked with and actually joined the 4th Reich during and after the Rusher War (ie Babbaj, jared2013, Sato86).

* [[The Vortex Coalition]] - At first The Vortex Coalition worked with Team Veteran to destroy sanctuaries and kill new players, but they declared neutrality after a few weeks due to many new players being interested in the group.

== Banner ==
The Team Veteran banner consists of 3 layers on top of a black banner base. Crafting this requires 1 Black Banner, 1 Oxeye Daisy, 5 Ink Sac and 6 Light Grey Dye. The banner is crafted as follows.[[File:Vetbanner.png|thumb|819x819px|centre]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5639">Temp maps/events are builds/maps that are used while the 2b2t map is being updated, or testing plugins, or just for fun.

If you know about any of the earlier temp maps and april fool's events, please add them.

(WIP)

== 2012 April Fool's Temp Map ==
In this [[April Fools Maps|April fool's event]], [[Hausemaster]] created a temp map and personally gave lots of high level and/or unobtainable items to lots of players, such as diamond gear, [[bedrock]], spawn eggs, etc, allowing players to build, grief and fight with essentially no limits.

== 2013 April Fool's Temp Map ==
TBA

== 2014 April Fool's Temp Map ==
This was a fairly simple April fool's event in which everyone was confined to a small space and destruction ensued. Notably, two factions, woodstock and team topkek, battled for control over the map over the course of the several days it was up, building bases, accumulating resources, and causing general widespread destruction.

== 2015 April Fool's Temp Map ==
This was an Isis-themed April fools event, with Isis music, a desert map, lots of explosions, and everything.

== 2016 April Fool's Temp Map ==
Not a true temp map, as Hausemaster did not create an april fool's temp map in 2016 as usual. However, as a substitute, Spartan512 created another server, 2b2tcity, for a few days, in which 2b2t players were invited to come and destroy a city adventure map.

== 1.9 to 1.10 Temp Map ==
This temp map was created in mid-june because the main map needed to be transferred to newer, better hardware because of the increasingly large map file size and the recent sudden influx of new players. While the rusher invasion began on june 1st, many would say that the actual [[The Rusher War|rusher war]] began on the temp map, as it was where the first actual battles between [[Team Rusher|rushers]] and regular players took place. [[Fit]] and other [[Team Veteran|veterans]] recorded themselves destroying numerous rusher sanctuaries and massacring large numbers of rushers on the temp map, which helped to escalate the conflict.

== 1.11.2 to 1.12 Temp Map ==

Unlike other temp maps, there was a world border of 4,000 by 4,000 blocks, this caused the following:

&lt;p data-parsoid=&quot;{&quot;dsr&quot;:[245,261,0,0]}&quot;&gt;-Nowhere was safe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-parsoid=&quot;{&quot;dsr&quot;:[263,337,0,0]}&quot;&gt;-Spawn was dead easy to escape, obtaining food after 5 minutes of joining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-parsoid=&quot;{&quot;dsr&quot;:[263,337,0,0]}&quot;&gt;-Actual bases were appearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-parsoid=&quot;{&quot;dsr&quot;:[263,337,0,0]}&quot;&gt;-There were still resorces on the map by the time the server had gone back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-parsoid=&quot;{&quot;dsr&quot;:[263,337,0,0]}&quot;&gt;-There was no group dedicated to removing water from the map&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-parsoid=&quot;{&quot;dsr&quot;:[263,337,0,0]}&quot;&gt;-[[Spawn Masons]] actually took it seriously and were guarding their base 24/7&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-parsoid=&quot;{&quot;dsr&quot;:[263,337,0,0]}&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-parsoid=&quot;{&quot;dsr&quot;:[263,337,0,0]}&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p data-parsoid=&quot;{&quot;dsr&quot;:[339,344,0,0]}&quot;&gt;(WIP)

== 2017 April Fool's Temp Map ==
On april 1st of 2017, the map was temporarily changed to a small enclosed amplified map in which hostile mob drop tables were changed so that they'd drop high-level items such as diamond gear, enchanted books, TNT, [[Suicide Bombing (Crystal/Bed Bombing)|end crystals]], wither skulls, [[Golden Apples|enchanted golden apples]], and more. The map quickly became a heavily destroyed free-for-all PVP pit with players duking it out in nonstop combat.

== March 2018 Temp Map ==
In march of 2018, the server needed to be transferred to a new, larger SSD because it was approaching 4000 GB in size. While the map had a border, it was sufficiently far out that players could establish bases reasonably far from spawn. In addition to many small surface bases, several skybases were established by some of the server's major groups, some of which remained ungriefed until the temp map ended because they were sufficiently well protected.

== 2018 April Fool's Temp Map ==
Like in the previous year's April fool's event, the map was changed to a small enclosed area. Initially it was about 1024x1024 blocks, but this was later reduced to 256x256. The map was a customized world with multiple layers of flat terrain stacked on top of each other, with the uppermost being very close to the height limit. Ore spawning was altered so that diamonds only spawned near the height limit (but in great quantities), gold could be found everywhere, and iron was rare. At one point, a bunch of ghasts and several enderdragons were spawned. As usual, over the course of time the map got more and more destroyed. Tons of skybridges and staircases were built, many bases were built near the top of the map, and the amount of available resources slowly diminished. At first, there were plenty of resources to go around and lots of players built cobblestone bases and wheat farms and got diamond gear, but as time went on, ores became less plentiful, and trees and saplings became rarer and rarer until they ran out completely. Basic things like crafting tables, stone tools, oak saplings, and water sources were jealously hoarded and fought over, and there were only a few sets of diamond armor in circulation that would eventually pass on from one player to another through accidental death.

== April Temp Map ==
The third temp map in as many weeks, this time created because [[curtis]] forgot to pay for the Archon network servers (of which 2b2t is one). A temp map was created until the problem was fixed. Because it was created on the same day as Antvenom's video, the 6th incursion and the ant war began on this temp map.[[Category:Miscellaneous]]

[[File:B96e4bdac1a7e570c2106f20356be7e36e44468a9.png|thumb|282x282px|TCR's skin]]
'''TheCampingRusher''' is the main leader of [[Team Rusher]], and is sometimes just referred to as Rusher or TCR. He is a large Canadian YouTuber with more than one million subscribers. He has gained a lot of hate from most of the oldfags, because they didn't like the attention he brought to the server and the destructive nature of his fans. His main goal on the server was to explore it and learn about it's history, and did not intend to cause a commotion on the server. Yet ironically his presence caused great damage to the server and its players.

== History ==
Rusher joined 2b2t on June 1st, 2016 and posted a video about it which made a ginormous rush to the server by his fans and independant viewers. This caused many oldfags to be pissed with him and so he began to recognise this.

Eventually, things began to get out of control and TCR declared war on the oldfags, in which he called OG's (Original Ganstas). This caused the oldfags to assemble into what we know today as [[Team Veteran]].

Rusher went on to be Team Veteran's number one target as the group conducted several massacres on his fans and have attempted to hunt him down. Team Veteran failed to actually hunt and kill his main account and send it back to spawn but they have gotten close twice. The first time was when [[Fit]] and his gang missed Rusher by atleast 10 minutes at the Valley of Wheat. The second was when Bitter Cynic found him at his paradise and a chase for him and Mr.Mitch occurred. The two eventually got away as Bitter tried to spawn trap Mr.Mitch as he logged off before death but failed. The two decided to be more cautious about coordinates and revealing their travel throughout the server in order to prevent Veteran recognition of the areas shown or figuring it out with a Minecraft Map Analyzer.

Due to Team Veteran constantly hunting for him, he never settled to create a base, attempting only twice to create a makeshift base. He remained a nomad as his two attempts were griefed by Team Veteran.

Fit actually admitted that Rusher didn't seem so bad as a person several times. As Rusher gained op gear, his mood of videos began to shift from the unintended war he caused and focused more on base tours and explaining history of the server to his fans. He eventually left 2b2t on October 22nd, 2016, as he began to lose ideas for the series, his fans were getting bored, and the start of school. He also planned to return to the server in mid-June of 2017.

Rusher managed to kill about 3-5 Veterans during his time on the server.

== Future? ==
It was questioned around the server whether Rusher would be returning to 2b2t in June of 2017. Torogadude believed that there is a 40% chance of Rusher returning to the server. Fit stated that Rusher would not return over the summer as he states that he is &quot;closest&quot; to Rusher and has had contact with him. Fortunately, he did not return to the server, and his channel has completely stopped being based around minecraft, too.

== Relationships ==
* [[FitMC]] - Fit is Rusher's archnemesis in 2b2t. Although it may look like they are enemies, behind the scenes it is revealed that Fit and Rusher allegedly had a partnership where Fit would give Rusher coordinates to some monuments and bases, leading to Fit gaining a lot of hate and the feeling of betrayal from some of his closest friends.
* [[Napkin0fTruth]] - Napkin and Rusher have been friends for a long time. Currently, Napkin acts as Rusher's rival in his factions show. Napkin originally wanted to be Rusher's rival on 2b so he joined the Veterans for a short amount of time. However, Napkin realised that the Veterans did not share the same values as he did and that the Veterans were not Rusher's enemies for rivalship and competition but rather a force to drive him and the rest of his faction buddies out. So he joined the Peacekeepers to make it seem that he was not on Rusher's side (for the whole faction rival thing) but still shared Team Rusher values (eventually the Peackeepers just became a Rusher subgroup in a sense).
* MrMitch361 - MrMitch361 is one of Rusher's best friends and faction buddy. MrMitch361 had followed Rusher through his entire journey on the server, being his right hand man the entire time and experienced every danger that the two faced.

== Drama ==
Rusher has gained a lot of hate and conspiracies against him during his time on the server. He has admitted to being responsible for the massive amounts of players joining and that it was his fault for causing the War.

The first conspiracy was that he was a jewtuber money whore who did everything on the server for money. He made a video where he admitted to being responsible behind the making of the Priority Queue System and that he can add or remove anyone he wishes, but he claims not to do so. He also claims that he did not implement the queue for the money and defended this claim by stating that people offered to pay HauseMaster money to get premium queue and Rusher aided Hause to create that queue so he did not suggest it.

He has also admitted to actually wanting to buy 2b2t from Hause (keep in mind that this offer was before tempmape). He stated that he wanted to buy the server in order to make it lag free and give it DDOS protection. However, Hause already did this during tempmape. He stated that for his first 2 years as a YouTuber, he did not get paid for his content, defending that he was not a jewtuber. He even offered to donate the money he gained from the queue to charity and has donated $250 per month to the server's benefit since the 8th episode in his series.

The 2b2t Police was a meme created by [[the 4th Reich]] which was presented through a video series on Tavux's and their youtube channel. The videos showed 4th kikes ironically acting as cops but destroying bases and killing players.

== Trivia ==
* These videos were mainly created by Tim and Tavux being the main cops
* A current member of the [[peacekeepers]] has an account named The2b2tPolice
* The first episode was one of the most popular videos on the 4th Reich's youtube channel.
* Before the Reich's disbandment, [[CorruptedUnicorn]] attempted to join the Reich and labeled his video, 2B2T: New Sherriff in Town, with a thumbnail saying 2b2t police and his skin in a police uniform.
* Dispite the split of the group, Tavux posted one more 2b2t police vid before the meme got kinda old.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3912">[http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline Timeline of 2b2t]'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''

---&gt; [[Forum Massacre Period]][[File:00-ImageMain (1).png|thumb|177x177px]]
The 4chan period was the first era of 2b2t history. Not much is known about this period, however all that is known is that the server began gaining popularity around 4chan. This brought the first wave of players.

This is the beginning of 2b2t. When 2b2t first opened it used to be a Garry’s Mod server but was eventually moved to Minecraft. We know that it was a Gmod server thanks to videos uploaded by [https://www.youtube.com/user/iReima Reima]. The name was based of a TF2 server called 2fort2furious, which was originally based off of  2fast2furious, the second film of the Fast and the Furious series. The basic story is that [[Georgebush420]], who ran the Garry’s Mod server, started a Minecraft server with the same premise – that you can do anything you want. Georgebush420 eventually gave one of his friends, Hausemaster, ownership of 2b2t as he had a much better connection and the two continue to own and run the server to this day. The two owners eventually advertised the server on /v/ and /b/ of 4chan, Facepunch, and SomethingAwful. 

According to [https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t/comments/6ovtia/recent_trend_of_2b2t_art/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=2b2t a subreddit post], spawn [https://imgur.com/a/lodty used to look this in 2010], the download of the 2010 spawn can be found [https://www.dropbox.com/s/ocubl7e9n22ojpu/Virgin%20Spawn.zip?dl=0 here]
[[File:958B1021-07D8-401C-A79A-A68231412B6C.jpeg|thumb|220x220px|2fort2furious logo, very similar to 2b’s older logo]]

== Information from Sato86 ==
[[File:Timeline 2016 (2)-0.png|thumb|59x59px]]
The truth is that there is little saved information about this first period. Only Hausemaster would be able to go into fine details. Nevertheless, it is likely that the server started to get popular for its promise of true anarchy. ‘4channers’ who wished to play on an online server couldn’t identify with the existing anarchy servers and also their admins. So 2b2t was - especially for /v/ and /b/ people - the place they wanted to play Minecraft online. The server started to be advertised on 4chan almost daily. People started to get online more and more. Spawn probably received the first wave of destruction at this point. The game was still on beta or alpha at the time.

The server  started around december of 2010. Its promised world without rules or boundaries was what attracted players from countless corners of the internet Among those corners, the one that stands out its 4chan. The server started to gain a great amount of players as it started to be constantly spammed in 4chan boards such as /v/ and /b/. The 4chan community always was an unruly one, so it would only make sense for them to play on a server without rules.


Their arrival on 2b2t not only increased the player numbers but it also left a permanent cultural mark on the server. They were the first that tried to turn 2b2t into a server as offensive as possible, so they could keep away all the little kids that were playing (and continue to play) minecraft. The use of swastikas, for example, was brought by them. To offend and shock anyone who instantly logged in at spawn. The swastika is widely known as a symbol of hate and it was that hate that fueled the first months of the server. You can imagine that nothing creative or productive came out of what we used to call “The 4chan Period”. If you wander 2b2t long enough, you can still find many of these swastikas and ruined buildings around from that time. The use of words “newfag”,” oldfag” and even the greentext would be a 4chan inheritance that 2b2t still carries with pride.

'''The 4th Reich''' is a group formed from the 2b2t discord. They started out as a small group of 2b2t discord members that wanted to band together to accomplish more than they could by themselves. As time went by they became more powerful and they are now considered to be a major force. Their end goal is to become as powerful and recognized as they possibly can, by griefing bases and killing players. Their main tactic is [[End Crystal suicide bombers|End Crystal bombing]]. They are hated on by many players, simply because they do anything to gain more power by ruining other player experience on the server. The 4th Reich also has it's own YouTube channel called [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_lmq3MQXeEVyvNkp7FXnWg The4thReichOf2b2t]. During the events of the Rusher War, they have griefed [[Peacekeepers|The Peacekeepers]] headquarters, Wrath outpost, NedaT's spawn base, Sargent Griff's base, PandaSauceYT's base on his own anarchy server and some other minor bases.
[[File:Nazi.png|thumb|220x220px|4th Reich Flag]]

== History ==
The team was founded by Tim_McNukepants, P529, Anar_NL in June 2016 after false rumors of the main 2b2t discord becoming for oldfags only. They decided that it would be best to have someone to base with from the start. Since no one of them had big bases they made one together. The 4th Reich were supposedly the sworn enemies of [[The Vortex Coalition]] and engaged in a war with them by apparently destroying their headquarters. This war was later found out to be entirely fake. After the [https://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/Memes#The_VoCo_vs_4th_Reich_War VoCo/4th Reich War meme] died down, the group moved closer to spawn and became somewhat of a sub group of [[Team Veteran]]. They then started accepting new members into the group since the 4th Incursion was about to begin. After a few weeks the 4th Reich grew into a group of both old and new players. After several conflicts with insiders from other groups that leaked the base coordinates, all the members became temporary nomads scourging spawn and its surroundings.

== Post-War ==
After the Rusher War, the 4th Reich continued their scourges and began to obliterate monuments such as Helios Base, Wrath Outpost, and the Drain. When [[Fit]] declared that [[Team Veteran]] has become a dormant group, waiting for the next YouTuber surge, the 4th Reich increased its rivalry with Team Aurora. The 4th Reich and Team Aurora began to skirmish with each other. The two eventually dragged the Peacekeepers into the conflict and [[the Three Way War]] began. This war continued until the end of the 5th Incursion.

On December 25, 2016, player 0xymoron traveled to Jewtopia and griefed it, all while streaming it live on YouTube. As the stream progressed, more players wanted to help grief. 3 hours after the livestream began, the base was destroyed. The maps were griefed, as well as lag machines, and many other contraptions.
[[File:Maxresdefault-1492474198.jpg|thumb|220x220px|4th Kikes in front of Helios Base before dumster ]]
0xymoron stated that the reason for this grief was because Tim (Tim_mcnukepants) disabled maps, and was griefing. 0xymoron also said that before the coordinates were sold by Tumorous, he found the base and decided to grief it.

Afterwards, Tim_Mcnukepants griefed 0xymoron's group base, museum and dupe stash in retaliation. This caused 0xymoron to rage, and make multiple reddit posts claiming, clients were backdoored, Tim_Mcnukepants bought the coords, and that knightvista has everyones coords on the server.

The group has done several griefings of major monuments such as Wrath Outpost, Garden of Eden, and Offtopia's Drain. The 4th Reich was a key player in the 5th Incursion as they attempted to construct an obsidian wall and their own FOB. However, the 5th Incursion was a disaster and none of this succeeded. After the incursion, the group continued griefing other bases like Lord Pasta's base, Barren Dome's base, Jerico City, map art bases, and did more damage to Space Valkyria. They were also involved in the third largest battle of spawn where they attacked Hermeticlock's spawn base. They attacked Fit when he was on his way to the spawn base.

== Destruction of Wintermelon ==
On March 16th, 2017, members of what remained of 4th Reich attacked [[Toshie|Toshie's]] melon group at [[Wintermelon]], waged a 16 player fight, and ended up griefing it. After this, the members of the Reich either quit the server, or joined the Spawn Masons during the rest of March. The discord is still active, but no other major events were done by the Reich since Wintermelon.

== Relations ==
* Team Rusher - The 4th Reich is enemies with Team Rusher as the 4th Reich is allied with Team Veteran so, they are enemies by default. They have conducted several assaults on Rusher settlements.
* Team Veteran - The 4th Reich had very strong ties with Team Veteran as some of the members of the 4th Reich are oldfags. 
* Team Aurora - The 4th Reich has been enemies with Team Aurora since the last month of the Rusher War. The bitterness between the groups began when the 4th Reich were talking shit around Neda T (back then a Resistance member). Once Neda created Team Aurora, the bitterness continued and even escalated to the groups exchanging griefings. Once Team Veteran was put to rest, the 4th Reich began calling Team Aurora members newfags. The two groups engaged in a three way war including the Peacekeepers.
* Peacekeepers - The 4th Reich has been enemies with the Peacekeepers since the early days of the Rusher War due to the Peacekeepers' Pro-Rusher values. The two groups have continued their hatred for each other since the Rusher War, and the two groups fought each other in a three way war including Team Aurora. Now the groups are allied.
* The Resistance - The Resistance was enemies with the 4th Reich due to the Resistance's Pro-Rusher values and the event between Neda T and the Reich.
* The Blind Eye Clan (Previously Ragnarok) - The 4th Reich is currently enemies with the minor group known as the Blind Eye Clan as the 4th Reich griefed their base during the events of The Three Way War.
== Trivia ==
* Many 4th Reich members became infamous griefers and the group has always caused trouble on the server.
* The members are referred to as 4th kikes (kike is a Jewish racial slur).
* The group is most directly responsible for the griefing of several monuments post-Rusher War and anything to do with lag machines.

'''[[Timeline|Timeline of 2b2t]]'''

&lt;-- [[Unification Period]]

--&gt; N/A

The Age of Rebirth began on June 1st, 2018 after the 31days31griefs event, when Jared2013 announced that the next period would be known as &quot;The Rebirth&quot; of 2b2t. So far the Period has included a few major lag events, 2 Youtubers and the server reaching 50,000 days old. The era is also appearing to be ironic in name due to a continuation of destruction with the griefs of Boedecken and Block Game Mecca and the leaking of several bases due to recent drama with [[the Museum]]. 

{{Infobox: History|length = June 1st, 2018 - present|player_rate = 120-320}}
== End of 31day31griefs ==
&lt;span&gt;In late May, rumors begin to circulate that the server has been &lt;/span&gt;[[Backdoors|backdoored]]&lt;span&gt;, due to many other major bases being griefed in addition to Empire's Edge, none of which had been discovered or made public to anyone's knowledge. It was revealed that &lt;/span&gt;[[Jared2013]]&lt;span&gt; was responsible, and as he griefed one base every day for the whole month of May, the event becomes known as 31days31griefs. &lt;span&gt;After nearly every major group base on the server is destroyed, &lt;/span&gt;[[Jared2013|Jared]]&lt;span&gt; says he will no longer grief anymore bases as part of the event and says this new period will be &quot;&lt;/span&gt;The Rebirth&lt;span&gt;&quot; of 2b2t.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

== Block Game Mecca Grief/Beardler Drama ==
Block Game Mecca was the largest base in the history of 2b2t. It was built in secrecy for a long time until it was griefed by Beardler, an admin of the 2b2t museum. The suspicions about the 2b2t museum from Boedecken's grief were true and it was not jared2013 but Beardler. Beardler also was caught mishandling IP addresses of players who had logged into the museum ([[jared2013]]). He said he grefied it to steal items that he wanted in his own personal museum, that he regretted his actions, and that he would take a three month break from the server as a result.  

== Resurfacing of 32k items ==
Near the end of June 2018 rumors began that 32k level items were &quot;back&quot; on the server. They of course had been there the whole time, just unusable due to Hausemaster's plugins. They currently are working and spreading very quickly. The player AlphaComputer is selling them on the server to anyone who wants to purchase them. If these weapons keep spreading at this rate it is likely there will be major conflict between players and teams. We may see PVP between players that all have 32k weapons, something that has never been seen on the server before. [[Category:History]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1175">The Apocalypse Exploit is an exploit that was discovered by the players [[fr1kin]], [[babbaj]] and [[0x22]]. The exploit involves a situation in which a player is in multiple places at once (player superposition). Because of this, the player using the exploit was able to load twice as much chunks as they would normally, and in addition make the server keep dividing their position by 8, unthil finally crashing due to the number getting too long (eg. if the outcome was 3.(3), the server would keep adding additional 3s unthil it would crash)
== How it worked ==
The exploit involved doing /kill on either an animal or vehicle in the nether. This would respawn the player in technically two places at once, near the portal where the player entered the nether and the proper spawn point of the player. This would confuse the server and cause it to start dividing the nether coordinates of the player by 8 unthil finally crashing due to the number being too long or invalid.
== Patch ==
This exploit was patched by [https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper Paperspigot] and updated on April 9th, 2017 with the introduction of [[Anti Cheat|AAC]].[[Category:2b2t]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5077">{{Rusher}}

The Archon is [[TheCampingRusher|TheCampingRusher's]] factions server. It's rather infamous in the minecraft community due to being strongly based on the &quot;pay-to-win&quot; model. This even lead to Mojang itself banning the server's IP for EULA violations, which was later undone. The [[Queue|2b2t queue]] is known to be hosted on the Archon network. &quot;X plays on The Archon&quot; is a common insult in the 2b2t community.

== Relating to 2b2t ==
The Archon is one of several servers that hosts the gamemode known as factions. The gamemode revolves around players creating factions (The Archon is an exception to this, as in order to make the server a good enviroment for idiots, [[TheCampingRusher|TCR]] created a set of leaderless factions which are built into the system), building unraidable bases, and competing with and raiding other factions in order to become the richest and most powerful on the specific server.

When Rusher first joined the server, he and several of his fans had the frame of thinking that 2b2t was a factions server. While the two are very similar in gameplay, they are different in economic ways. Factions servers are more capitalist in nature, and could be argued to be a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minarchism minarchist] economy. This is because factions servers tend to have the ''laissez-faire ''policy (yeah that thing that you learned about in history that Thomas Jefferson implemented but no one gave a fuck about it so you forgot about it) which means it has very limited control over players and their privately owned items and property, however way more than an anarchy server would. This ''laissez-faire'' capitalist system is what allows players to gain property by creating factions and claiming territory, which cannot be modified unless getting into the faction or using a tnt cannon, and the use of trade and currency in most faction servers. The server provides essential rules that players must follow (ruling out that it is anarchy), such as no hacking and not vulgar language/spam in chat, but for the most part, players can do whatever they please in order to get richer and more powerful.

This proved to be a struggle for several of Rusher's fans as they were not used to, or simply did not know, the harsh conditions of 2b2t, which was pure [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutualism_(economic_theory) mutualism], where you could never truly own your build, causing them to create bases near spawn and getting destroyed easily due to them thinking that no one could raid them without proper equipment.

The public 2b2t opinion of faction servers, especially oldfags who have never played factions and barely any knowledge of what it is, deemed faction servers the complete opposite of anarchy servers, which is truly not the case. While there are several differences listed below, they are not polar opposites, simply different as one has limited server control over players and the other is void of any server control. In fact, a totalitarian server would be the polar opposite, where the server owned all means of production, property, and even movements of players, eliminating pure freedom in the process, and imposing pure rule and domination. While such servers exist, they usually falsely claim they are &quot;anarchy&quot; servers, while having the administration abuse their power in order to maintain control of a group of &quot;helpers&quot; and raid independent players in creative mode/with godmode/using hacked items until they either quit or agree to join the group of &quot;helpers&quot;. However, these servers are usually modded and have a playerbase under 30 players.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1812">The 2b2t Arms Race, also known as the Cold War, was a time period in 2b2t history that lasted for 3 years, from December of 2013 during the [[First Valkyrian Period]] and ended in the spring of 2016, during the [[Pre-Hype Period]], right before [[ Age of Hype|The Age of Hype]]. This event was a large scale search for the ominous super weapons created by Pyrobyte and [[iTristan]] during the second [[Backdoors|backdoor]] of 2b2t. The weapons were known as the 32K weapons as they had enchantment levels of 32767, which would essentially render the wielder of these weapons invincible. These weapons were reserved to a select few, however, as time went on, the weapons were traded, donated, lost, and acquired through death.

These weapons included:
* sharpness levels that could kill anything in a single hit
* knockback levels that could kick a player for flying
* thorns levels so high that if an opponent touched the wearer, they would die instantly
* fortune levels that could cause so much loot to spawn from either mobs or ores that it could crash the server
* efficiency levels that could instantly break anything, no matter the tps of the server.
* Splash potions with infinite stacking
* Several others with varying abilities
The weapons were mass produced during the third backdoor by the [[Backdoor Crew]]. The Arms Race ended when Hause returned most of these items to their normal stats and patched the third backdoor of 2b. However, legend has it that some weapons survived Hause's purge and one weapon has been confirmed to exist and now resides beyond the world border.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3617">The Asylum was a group founded by cityboss1 sometime in November/December of 2017. The group was prominent during the Unification Period and participated in multpile griefs, insides, builds, and group conflicts throughout the timeframe.  
[[File:AsylumLogo.png|thumb|220x220px|The Asylum Logo (Has a similar appearance to the V Fawkes Logo)]]

== History ==
After the disband of his first group, V Fawkes, in 2016, cityboss1 continued to play on the server until he decided to found the Asylum in late 2017. The group grew rapidly, similarly to many of the other groups around the time period. 

=== First Group Conflict ===
The Asylum’s first group conflict started with the Guild, SmackAttack86’s newfag group. The Guild was insided and crushed to oblivion by the Asylum, the Emperium, who were strong allies, and the Highland. With most of the members bedtrapped, builds griefed, and SmackAttack86 quitting,  the Guild faded out of existence and the Asylum rose to prominence.

=== More Conflict ===
The group was initially friendly towards the Peacekeepers up until Pandasauce began to be rude towards cityboss1 and the two became enemies. The Asylum soon begun to grief Peacekeeper bases. The Asylum also came into conflict with Highland due to Asylum’s relations with the Emperium.
[[File:V Fawkes Banner converted.png|thumb|243x243px|Asylum Banner]]

=== The Vo-Perium War ===
During the Vo-Perium War, the Asylum aided the Emperium against the Vortex Coalition for the roughly three weeks that it lasted. Infrared made an alliance with VoCo and so, by default, became enemies of the Asylum and the Emperium. Once the war ended, VoCo, the Emperium, and the Asylum began to make better relations. But the Asylum and the Emperium continued hostilities towards Infrared. 

=== The UGE and AA conflict ===
When the Emperium founded the United Group Embassy (UGE), the Asylum was the first group to join. Eventually much smaller groups and factions begun to join the UGE and the alliance invited Highland, Infrared, and the Peacekeepers. However, the three groups betrayed the UGE by destroying the first UGE base and leaking the third. The three groups then created their own alliance, the Alpha Alliance (AA), in which they sought to destroy the UGE. The UGE managed to fend off the AA and the war eventually died out. 

=== UGE inactivity and the 6th Incursion ===
When the UGE eventually begun to be inactive, the Asylum left the alliance. Once the 6th Incursion rolled along, the Asylum participated in the domination of the temp maps and spawn along with VoCo, the Spawn Masons, and the Emperium. The group fought the Antfag Invasion and the former AA members during the incursion. However, cityboss1 got sick in real life and was unable to participate further. He was eventually demoted in the 6th Incursion discord due to inactivity. 

=== Asylum Disband and Post-Asylum Drama ===
Due to city becoming sick and unable to play, the Asylum soon became inactive and city was eventually forced to disband the group. Once city recovered, he returned to the server and ended up being friends with Retronaut, the leader of Infrared, and the Emperium began to spread a rumors that City “dated Retronaut” and the group eventually distrusted him. 

== Trivia ==
* The group’s banner and symbol were brought from city’s previous group, V Fawkes.
* The group, according to city, did not face many betrayals or insides.
* The group was around the 4th largest group on the server during late 2017 and early 2018.

[[File:TheBlindEyeClanBanner.png|thumb|275x275px|The Blind Eye Clan Banner (colors may vary)]]
'''The Blind Eye Clan''' was a group of players who were dedicated to blowing up spawn. They did not want to be recognized as a faction like team but rather as just a group of players with similar interests. They were essentially the opposite of [[Team Uberslugcake]] who were dedicated to fix spawn.

==History==
The first member of the clan was Flip who had a plan of blowing up spawn since he first joined 2b2t. He didn't have enough Slime Blocks and helpers for the bombers so he individually invited other players to join the cause. The Blind Eye Clan tried to make a peace treaty with [[Team Aurora]] and the [[Peacekeepers]] for the first official bombing of the spawn that was scheduled on the 22th of October, 2016. The Triple Treaty (TTT) was made but due to leaks about meetup base coordinates the bombing was canceled and the base was griefed by [[The 4th Reich]]. Later on the Blind Eye Clan left The Triple Treaty due to not wanting to limit its members. After the 11/11 dupe, the Clan had enough resources for the whole bombing of spawn. 

The Clan scheduled to once again attempt to bomb spawn during the 5th Incursion as jared2013 called for the leveling of spawn. However, this never happened as the 5th Incursion began to decline. As the 5th Incursion began to die, it brought the clan down with it and the group eventually disbanded.  

==Relations==
Since The Blind Eye Clan tries to stay as just a group of players with similar interests they don't have any official allies or enemies but most of the clan members hate [[The 4th Reich]] for delaying the bombing.

Most of the former members merged with VoCo (ie househousehouse1, Sheer, and Flip35).

In December of 2017, Flip began supporting Team Rainbow, so we can assume that Team Rainbow would be neutral to The Blind Eye Clan if it were to ever be revived.

-silentpedro, May 30th, 2018

'''The Boedecken '''was a base founded by Caineslaw in 2016 after the destruction of [[Aureus City]] during the events of the Rusher War. The group was kept secret for around 2 years until it was leaked and eventually griefed by Beardler,a former [[The Museum|Museum]] member, during [[2b2t Community Drama|the Museum drama]] of 2018. The base was another victim of this drama along with [[Block Game Mecca]]. 

== History ==
When Caineslaw's second base, Aureus City, was destroyed in 2016 during the Rusher War, Caineslaw went out to found a new base he named &quot;The Boedecken&quot;, which ended up being one of the biggest bases the server had ever seen. Caineslaw eventually started to invite members from Aureus and even new members, under the condition that no one would ever release photos or talk about it publicly due to all the coordinate exploits roaming rampant. 

The build continued to expand to enormous lengths and remained secret for the next two years up until May of 2018 when Museum operator and console access member, Beardler, was invited to BGM and the Boedecken. When Beard reached the Boedecken, it was found to be relatively close to axis. He later leaked and destroyed the base for apparently wanting rare items and Caines' book collection. The griefing of the base was initially blamed on Jared2013's 31days31griefs, similarly to the thinking of BGM's members as the base was griefed around the same time. However, Caineslaw did some investigating and noticed that the most damage to the base was his library and the artifact storage. He later discoverered it was Beardler in a museum group chat, who was the first to notice the base was griefed and blew up the base to cover his tracks of stealing the items. 

After the bases' grief, community outlash broke out on Beardler and he was demoted and removed from his positions on multiple discords and groups. This lashing out led to the eventual destruction of [[Purgatory 2]], a revenge raid.</text>

The Cult of [[Jared2013]] is an ideology created by [[Social Classes|newfags]]. Not much is known about it except that it exists and somehow revolves around behaving like Jared2013. It's likely the most autistic thing on [[2b2t]] ever, as both Jared and newfags tend to be very autistic. Jared has even stated himself that he find this whole worshipping boring and not recommended on a reddit Q&amp;A. Thus even Jared himself is not autistic enough for this cult.</text>

The Cult of Popbob is a widespread ideology amongst newfags. It revolves around praising [[Popbob]], griefing monuments and hoping that Popbob will come back one day. It was created due to [[FitMC]] often mentioning Popbob in his videos and talking about him like if he was some kind of super-villain. This lead newfags to believing they can get recognised as someone important on the server by being a typical autistic skid, overlooking the fact that Popbob was likely using his own hacked client and had backdoor access, as well as actually being a very damaged person. This belief was likely the reason for most of the recent destruction that happened to [[The Valley of Wheat]], [[spawnbase]]s and other monuments. </text>

The Emperium is one of the more prominent groups on the server, gaining the spotlight after the fall of the [[Spawn Masons]] and the [[Peacekeepers]] during the summer of 2017. Founded by TheDark_Emperor, The Emperium grew slowly, and carefully selected members. Even in their infancy they turned away people who did not meet their criteria. The symbol of the group is the omega, which they pridefully plaster wherever they go.

==History==

Back around December 2016, TheDark_Emperor decided he had had enough of his boring life alone and created The Emperium. Having joined 2b2t post-Rusher, it was a surprise how many people decided to help him build up the group. It grew fairly quickly after a quality member base was formed. The base known as &quot;Arrowhead&quot; became the centerpiece of the Emperium and established a hopeful future on the server. Currently, the Emperium is one of the largest groups on the server, maintaining almost 50 active members

Some of the more notable things the Emperium has accomplished is an insiding of the [[Peacekeepers]] that directly caused the creation of &quot;The Order of Lucifer&quot; (a small 15-20 member group that seceded from PK after Ericudo's inside attempt). 

When the Emperium was first founded, it was mostly only a building group. Several bases were made that are still around today that the Emperium takes much pride in. As time began to progress, however, the Emperiums main focus started to shift from just building, to other things, including trading and deals with groups like [[Singularity]] and [[Team Coca Cola]]. This involvement with other groups started to get their name out into the faction community.

However, when the [[Peacekeepers]] began fighting anyone around spawn during the summer of 2017, the Emperium decided to take its own form of action. Several battles ensued, both sides receiving its own share of victories. During this fight, The Emperium allied with the newly seceded group &quot;The Order of Lucifer&quot;. Lucifer for the most part was unaware of the Emperiums involvement in their secession. The conflict began to die down as the number of active members in the Peacekeepers also died down, and the Emperium largely returned to just building bases (including a large obsidian outpost around 2000 blocks from spawn during when the Spanish youtuber joined) and dealing peacefully with other groups.

The Emperium nowadays has stuck to what has kept it active and successful, building bases with members that it can trust and dealing with other groups when it needs to, this includes major contributions to the creations of the [[United Group Embassy]]. The Emperium currently is over a year and a half old.

== Build Project: &quot;Empire's Edge&quot; ==
Back in around October-November of 2017, the Emperium decided that it needed a base to test some of its newly semi-trusted members. The idea started small, and at first only a core 4-5 people were invited. This was to begin the general structure of the base and begin setting up ideas for main builds. 
[[File:EE 2b.png|thumb|220x220px|Empire's Edge]]
[[File:EE 2b Ship.png|thumb|220x220px|Slimestoners Ship. ]]
After a few months, the base began to take a different look and meaning. The small amount of people invited quickly grew to around 10-15, and the base rose in stature and design. Unique builds began to shape the area and each persons individual project marked [[Empires Edge]] with their own forms of creativity. The base quickly grew into the largest and most active base in Emperium history, and certainly was the pride of every builder.

However a growing concern was the actual security of the base. Now with about 18 people having been invited and having made a mark on the base, the chances of the base getting leaked grew exponentially. 
[[File:EE 2b Capitol.png|thumb|220x220px|The main capitol building, by TheDark_Emperor]]
Around March of 2018, the base hit its highest amount of activity with over 10 people online and helping build at once, inspiring Emperial members to outdo their base mates and make larger and more impressive builds. Dozens of massive structures rose and dozens more creative and inspiring creations filled in the gaps made by the larger builds. Although there was no theme and generally it looked rather hectic, it showed the creativity and mindsets of each individual builder, and was an inspiration for other members to prove their own worthiness.

This competitive and spirited nature created a solid, core group in the Emperium, building levels of trust and friendship in each member invited.  
[[File:EE 2b Storage.png|thumb|220x220px|Storage for builds and duped items]]
However, such is the nature of 2b2t for a base to eventually get found and griefed. Empire's Edge is no different. On May 17th, 2018, the base was leaked to the reddit and that's where it ended. Emperial members quickly got online and removed the various amounts of equipment and duped items that were there as fast as possible while several other members guarded the highway to the base itself, holding off anyone who may want to attack the base before it was cleared. After this, the base was destroyed, in the only way Emperial members would allow. By the Emperium.

Although it is a shame that the base fell, the spirit of the base and the Emperium as a whole lives on, and more bases will be created that will no doubt be filled with the same level of inspiration and creativity of Empire's Edge, however, it'll no doubt be made more secure then the previous.

== The Slaughter of Visionary ==
The small group previously known as the Visionary Organization was the first &quot;real&quot; group to directly challenge the Emperium. Their leader, Sinatra, was fond of a discarded Emperium member known as Simplybob. Simplybob was salty over the constant harassing and theft when he interacted with Emperial members so he convinced Sinatra to have a hostile attitude towards the group. After being insulted and kicked from the discord, the Emperial leadership at the time came up with the idea to inside Visionary through various tactics and force them to disband. In about two weeks, coords were obtained and they set out to grief their sub-tier capital. A few days later the second pair of coordinates were obtained and a second base was griefed. After Visionary's constant failure, lack of good leadership, and a few of their own poorly executed insidings, the discord was deleted and everyone gave up. This challenge of authority and position was foolish on the part of Visionary and gave the Emperium a way to show that they were a serious group.

== The &quot;Vo-Perium&quot; War ==
The [[Vortex Coalition]] and the Emperium had a history of not getting along very well. Initially they both for the most part just ignored each other, but tensions rose to a much higher level after some deaths at spawn and a few words thrown around caused both sides to begin a full on conflict. On December 21, 2017, VoCo took the first step and declared the &quot;Vo-Perium&quot; war. However there is more history than just two groups not getting along.

On January 23, 2017, a group named &quot;[[Singularity]]&quot; was born, spawning after the second Phase of VoCo came to a close. Many members of VoCo had felt that the group they had grown with had become simply a bad meme and split off from it, creating Singularity. After Singularity was formed, they allied with the Emperium (sometime in late February) and brought with them a general disliking towards VoCo. This distaste heightened even further after American Oreo threatened Singularity's leader &quot;HolyBruhBrine&quot; with his dox, forcing him to leave the server. Most of Singularity's members left the disbanded group and fled to the Emperium.

Despite these events, the Emperium still didn't actively try to destroy VoCo. For the most part, they just bought time and continued to gain strength until they could do so.

This changed when Coltsnid and TheDark_Emperor began bad mouthing each other, which quickly resulted in conflict. However, after about a couple weeks, almost nothing had been done. VoCo released videos of the destruction of Emperial bases, though they were crappy and weren't used and Emperium blew up a couple small VoCo outposts, though for the most part nothing had been done. Eventually both sides gave up and decided to end the fighting and created a mutual discord for both groups to talk in and to grow familiar with each other.

Although VoCo and The Emperium aren't necessarily the closest of allies, they've grown closer than before, even sharing a few bases together. The negative history for the most part has been forgotten, and a future of cooperation seems to be in the making.

== The Unending War with Infrared ==
About two weeks prior to the Vo-Perium war (around early December 2017), the Emperium formed an alliance with two newly formed groups known as &quot;Inferno&quot; and &quot;Asylum&quot;. Around this time, the Emperium was actively trying to form alliances with smaller groups and help them grow. The idea was to create a powerful system of alliances so in case conflict arose, they'd be ready.The Emperium connected particularly quickly with Asylum, forming friendships and even sharing members as their alliance grew stronger. This was not the case for Inferno. The Emperium quickly began to detest Inferno and their generally immature and annoying attitude, to the point where after about a week into their alliance, several insiders were planted in Inferno.

Within the day, an Inferno base was griefed and this show of power frightened Inferno leader &quot;Racewizard.&quot; He decided that he would side with the Emperium because &quot;the Emperium was clearly the winning side.&quot; Believing this, he had no problem with handing over five main bases of Inferno, all of which were griefed the next day. Around this time, tensions began to grow with VoCo and with Inferno destroyed, the Emperium was feeling confident confronting an old enemy. Although Inferno disbanded, quickly they reformed into modern day [[Infrared]], and immediately officially declared war against the Emperium, starting a war that has continued for eight continuous months.

Although Infrared sided with VoCo in the VoPerium war, they did not attempt to make peace when the other parties decided to. The Emperiums conflict with Infrared continued, and although Infrared was persistent, they seemed almost unable to do any kind of damage to the Emperium. Infrared was constantly losing pvp battles at spawn and getting almost all of their newly established bases insided and griefed, yet they continued. After to formation of the [[United Group Embassy]], the Emperium attempted to make peace with Infrared, inviting them into the U.G.E. Ultimately, it didn't work as Infrared rejected to offer and griefed the collective group embassy base. Although everything valuable was removed from the base prior to the grief, the other members in the U.G.E. mutually agreed to hostile relations towards Infrared. 

This powerful alliance of 14 groups and a collective total of 100+ members posed an impossible challenge for Infrared. Although they attempted to inside the U.G.E. through a former ally [[Unidad]], Infrared proved incapable of hurting such a foe. This resulted in the creation of the &quot;Alpha Alliance&quot; made up of the Peacekeepers, Infrared, and [[Highland]]. The Emperium who had already helped defeat the Peacekeepers and proved that Highland was no threat to them, didn't require much help from the U.G.E. to crush any hopes AA had of posing a threat. The three already weakened groups could barely scrape together five active fighters at spawn, while The Emperium and U.G.E. representatives broke twenty several days in a row. Even with the collective effort, Infrared proved little match for the Emperium. 

Thus begins the Sixth Incursion. With a weakened Alpha Alliance, the Emperium shifted its focus to helping the Incursion thrive. Being the military arm, it provided constant support to the other groups in the Incursion, helping build the wall while also helping kill anyone who attempted to thwart the plans of the Incursion at spawn. The Alpha Alliance took a bold step and attempted faced off against the combined might of the Incursion, but proved absolutely useless. The constant slaughter at spawn and the negative coverage coming from [[Fit]], AA quickly fell. The Peacekeepers grew inactive once more and Highland began to fight with Infrared. 

As the Sixth Incursion came to a close, The Emperium attempted to go back to normal activities, building at [[Empires Edge]] and creating a new base with recruits, trying to ignore and put aside the prior actions of Infrared. Although the war hadn't ended, for about two weeks, very little happened. That is until The Emperiums &quot;Zeta Base&quot; is leaked by Lex, an insider from Infrared. After nearly six months of fighting, the first negative blow to the Emperium was dealt. Although the way the base was leaked had been easily preventable, it still proved the Emperium wasn't invincible. However, no real damage had been done as the Emperium was able to remove all valuable before the attack. 

After this, the war continued once more and over the course of the months until early July 2018. Infrared decided it was in their best interests to attack a VoCo outpost, causing the Emperium and VoCo to ally, thus beginning the now ongoing &quot;VoPerium V Infrared War&quot;. 

Who knows when it will end. 

==Foreign Relations==

[[Highland]]: Highland and the Emperium were almost always on the brink of conflict, however, they are now much more formal enemies.

[[Astral Order]] : Loose alliance

[[The Society]] : Alliance

[[The Vortex Coalition]] : After a short &quot;war&quot;, both sides declared peace for the time being. They are now allies.

[[Unidad]]: Loose alliance

[[The Soviets]] : Loose alliance

[[Infrared]]: Emperium betrayed an initial alliance due to the sheer presence of autism, so Infrared has placed it in their own hands to form a bit of a &quot;rebellion&quot;.

[[Spawn Masons]]: Relations have never been the closest, but cooperation with the 6th Incursion has greatly reduced tensions.

[[United Group Embassy]]: The Emperium is directly responsible for the creation of the U.G.E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3808">The End is one of the three possible dimensions that a player can [[travel]] to in the world of Minecraft. It is a vast void where the infamous ender dragon resides, where 90% of the endermen population resides, where islands of end stone are as far as the eye can see, and where end cities are.

== Pertaining to 2b2t ==
The End has always been a problematic issue on 2b2t, mainly for [[Hausemaster|Hause]], because of the rarity of portals. First of all, when the world was updated to 1.0, only three end portals were available in the entire world. Eventually, players found them all, and since during the really old days there were a variety of normal ways to destroy them (such as simply using TNT), they were all griefed. Additionally, portals themselves have been artificially created by players using hacks.

These issues have caused Hause to remove and re-enable the end multiple times, and in later years, to build and maintain end portals near spawn. Hause even destroyed portals himself in several instances, in order to ensure players did not reach the end when it was disabled. Hause's &quot;official&quot; end portals near spawn were removed and/or blocked off regularly, by players who used dragon eggs to delete portal blocks, and bedrock to cover them up. Eventually, he installed a plugin that would automatically replace any end portal blocks that were removed, and installed a plugin to make bedrock unusable by players so they couldn't use it to block off portals.

The End has been mostly barren and largely inaccessible for several years, leading to a relatively small population of players that have ever reached the end and an even smaller population of players that have ever lived in it. For a long time, most people didn't care much about the End, due to the dangers it posed, the lack of portals to reach it, and the general lack of content.  

The main area where the ender dragon resides has been lavacasted, withered, and largely destroyed multiple times, with the damage growing constantly over the years and up to the present. However, despite the griefing, the central area of the End has mainly retained its former structure, with the end stone landscape still being largely visible and many of the obsidian pillars still being intact.  

With the 1.9 update, the end was largely expanded, and this prompted a rush of exploration into the distant unloaded regions of the end in order to obtain Elytras and Chorus Fruits. Several skybases were abandoned and/or griefed because of this, including [[Space Valkyria]] and the DFC. When Shulker Boxes were added in 1.11, another rush of exploration occurred so everyone could get Shulker Shells, which was bigger and more heavily publicized due to the [[The Rusher War|rusher war]] happening at the same time.  

== Trivia ==
* Since the end has been occupied by players through all versions since its addition in 1.0, it is a strange mismatch of old and new end terrain generation. The central island has the randomly placed pillars that were originally generated in 1.0, plus the circular ring of pillars generated in 1.9 when the end was revamped. Both the portal originally created when the enderdragon was originally killed, and the new portal at the middle of the aforementioned ring of pillars, are present. There are large sections of totally empty sky in the space beyond the central island where players explored before 1.9, which abruptly transition to the post-1.9 network of floating landmasses once you veer off the paths the original explorers took.
* Many years ago, a glitch caused huge plains of flat bedrock to be generated along the bottom of the end. A number of bases were built on these bedrock plains.

&quot;The Face of Minecraft Anarchy&quot; was the intended title for AntVenom's 2b2t video. At the time the video was most expected, Auion, part of the [[+X Digging Group|Nether Highway Group]], decided to create, and post, a fake video to the subreddit. The shitpost gained quite a bit of attention, bringing in 100 upvotes, Reddit gold gifted by [https://www.reddit.com/user/2F4U_2b2t 2F2U], and even a comment from [https://www.youtube.com/user/AntVenom AntVenom] himself.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5212">The Facepunch War was a rebellion in 2b2t against the rising [[Facepunch Republic]] by the [[4channers|4chan Anarchists]]. It occurred during 2011-2012. It started when a player named [[Chezhead]] rallied everyone on the Facepunch forum to join 2b2t and form a peaceful anarchy in the server. The 4channers disagreed with this and attempted to take down the Facepunch Republic.

== Summary ==
The Facepunch War began in April of 2011 when Chezhead led most of the Facepunch members to 2b2t. This caused chaos among the community and the 4channers wanted to take down the Facepunchers. The Facepunchers started to build bases among the server and tried to make a peaceful anarchy. The 4channers stalked and killed Facepunchers and griefed their bases.
== Major Events ==
Some of these do not have dates as they have been lost over the years.
* April 27th, 2011 - Chezhead begins first 2b2t related thread on facepunch.com and declares the founding of the Facepunch Republics to bring a peaceful anarchy. 4channers assemble to combat this. A KOS list is assembled by Chez.
* April 28th, 2011 - Greyskull's Stand marks first battle of the impending war. Camp Facepunch destroyed by Luke2thebun. Chezhead denies war.[[File:Greyskull's stand.png|thumb|220x220px|Remains of Greyskull's Stand]]
* April, 2011 - July, 2011 - Peak of war and Republic power. Several bases made and destroyed by raiders and [[4channers]].
*July, 2011 - October, 2011 - Republic idea begins to wane and decline. The last thread of the Republic on facepunch.com is started on July 7th, 2011, titled &quot;2b2t V2: there is no FP republic&quot;. Facepunchers begin to quit 2b and give up. Chezhead gives up on the Republic in October.[[File:2b2t Policemike grief (Fp)|thumb|330x330px]]
* October, 2011 - February, 2012 - Players continue to try and keep the Republic together with the departure of Chezhead as leader. This fails and the Republic collapses in February.
* June, 2012 - Last band of facepunchers, led by Phagocytic, dedicated to the Republic try and  create a spawn base known as [[2k2k|Zion]], with the hopes to constantly rebuild it to make griefers give up. This fails as facepunchers got tired of constantly rebuilding and began to lose hope. The group slowly gave up and disbanded causing the end of the old Republic. 

== Trivia ==
* The war in itself is almost similar to [[The Rusher War]] four years later: a group of new players trying to make a change in 2b2t, with old players trying to take them down. Major differences include the fact that the amount of facepunchers joining the server was less, not more, than the amount of people who already played, and the fact that the facepunch community was much less centralized around a specific leader, and (somewhat) more mature, than the [[TheCampingRusher|TCR]] community.
* Despite the war having much less casualties than the Rusher War, 4 years later, the war saw more armed combatants die than in the Rusher War due to the fact that the war was during the Beta stages of Minecraft, meaning enchantments, god armor, crystals, totems, withers, etc, were not a thing back then, making killing much easier than it is today. The only reason the Rusher War outweighs in the casualties department, is because of the mass slaughter of the newfags at spawn, who barely had anything, if not nothing.

== Discrepancies ==
Despite this war being similar to the Rusher War and fought for the same reason, to get newfags off the server, Team Rusher and the Republic were completely different in motive on the server. The Republic wanted to change the way the server was played, and the 4channers saw this as an insult, while the Rushers were more or less like bad tourists, who wanted to explore 2b's history, but had those bad apples in the group that ticked off the Vets. Think of it like 2b2t is the museum, the Rushers are the tourists, and the Vets, in a sense, a really bad security force. Like with all tourists, you have to have that idiot who goes and touches the painting or sculpture (monuments in 2b's case), and so the bad security force gets mad and causes a rampage, which causes more paintings and sculpture touching.

== Major Groups Involved ==
* Facepunch Republic
* 4channers

== Minor Groups Involved ==
* Judge's group - recruited from both sides
* Brotherhood of Diamonds - gave diamonds to anyone
* Various raider groups and independents

The Fellowship of the Diamond was one of the oldest groups of 2b2t. The group tended to keep to themselves, which is why many players forgot about them and didn't even know about them. The group made several bases around spawn. The group had several &quot;fellowships&quot; which were essentially sub-groups of the overall group.

==History==
The Fellowship of the Diamond was founded by the players KillerCapybara, zhode, serphantking12, and _ironeagle_ when they logged into 2b2t. The first base they set up was called the &quot;700 base&quot; which was 700 blocks away from spawn (duh). It didn't last long and because of that, they decided to move further away. 

They made another base called &quot;3000 base&quot; that according to KillerCapybara &quot;lasted us through September and part of October&quot;. After their base was found they packed their limited items and moved further away to a place they felt safe

During Mid-October they built the biggest base they ever built called &quot;8000 base&quot;. It was an underground base with important things such as a central tree farm, animal pens, and a chest room. It also had some weird shit such as an art gallery, a strip club, and a church dedicated to a sheep that was said to have crashed the server. They had everything underground until they constructed a cobblestone castle outside of their base. 

They all based together for a while until bickering boiled out into the group. Because of this, they came to a general agreement that they had to change some things to keep their group from falling apart. It was at this moment that they came up with the name, the &quot;Fellowship of the Diamond&quot;, and the group split into fellowships with separate leaders but were still part of the same group and remained friendly with each other.

After the &quot;8000&quot; base, they made multiple other bases, but those bases were griefed shortly after their creation and before they knew it, &quot;8000 base&quot; had been griefed too. They moved on to their last base that was made on a mushroom biome, but by that point most of the members left due to boredom and shortly after zhode and Capybara stopped playing completely.
==Rebirth of the Fellowship of the Diamond==
In March of 2015, Capybara found the jamesrustles 2b2t blog and read about all the things he missed when he was gone. He decided to convince zhode to play again while bringing a new friend to help repair the damaged &quot;8000 base&quot;.

Capybara created the tugboat and the stone brick tower, it got griefed, most of the members quit, Capy moved out, inspired the older members to play again, etc.
==Information from KillerCapybara==
This was taken from jamesrustles.com and was posted by KillerCapybara

Greetings, KillerCapybara here. I’ve been playing on the server for quite a long time now and have never really made a name for myself. There are some players who everyone knows and loves, others who everyone knows and hates, and players like me who no one cared about but have been playing for just as long. After the Rusher incident, many more people became interested in the history of the server and people like James Rustles, Sato, and Fit wrote and made videos about things that happened on the server years and years before this swarm of newfags had even heard of 2b2t. Seeing some of these posts about or mentioning some of the things that I have participated in on the server made me realize just how much has been lost to time and forgotten. As cool and informative as Sato’s “The Groups of 2b2t” blogpost and Fit’s “2b2t: Tugboat Base” video are, there is some misinformation in there that I feel the need to correct.



The story begins in August 2011. My friends and I had been playing Minecraft together for awhile, experimenting with build challenges, adventure maps, and survival maps. While we had been enjoying the game, we were looking for something more to challenge ourselves and play with other people. One of my friends, zhode, had been browsing 4chan when he saw a post about 2b2t.net, a vanilla anarchy Minecraft server with no rules, mods, or admins. It looked perfect; a server that was challenging but still the same vanilla Minecraft experience.



zhode had warned us that the first thing we would see when we logged on would show us exactly what we were getting into. I was the first to log on with him and the first thing I saw was a giant, flaming netherrack swastika above my head and two guys in diamond armor flying above us engaged in PVP combat. That was when we knew we had found our server. Our gang consisted of zhode, serphantking12, _ironeagle_, and myself. Together we sought out to survive and thrive in the most hostile server out there.



The first base we set up was not too impressive and extremely close to spawn. We dubbed it our ‘700 Base’ as it was only 700 blocks away from spawn. This began our very uncreative naming scheme for all of our bases to come. It unsurprisingly did not last very long and we found ourselves moving even further away.

Our next base was one we dubbed our ‘3000 Base.’ It was once again unimpressive but lasted us through September and part of October. Our base was only discovered once another person with the lack of knowledge to move further away from spawn moved in only a couple hundred blocks away. We packed up our limited supplies and decided to move even further away to a place where we felt safe.

In mid-October, we built our biggest base yet. The '8000 Base' was the one we put the most effort into. It wasn't anything amazing and in many ways is extremely confusing and poorly designed. But it was our home so we didn't care. It was an underground base with necessities such as a large central tree farm, animal pens, and chest room along with some goofy stuff like an art gallery, a strip club, and a church dedicated to a sheep that we heard had crashed the server (though I'm not sure if that ever actually happened).

Everything remained underground but eventually we constructed a cobblestone castle outside of our base. This was the only structure that would be above ground at the base for four years.

We based together for awhile and eventually a bit of bickering began to bubble up in the group. After an incident involving me killing _ironeagle_ over some diamonds, we came to a consensus that we had to change some things to keep from falling apart. It was at this point we came up with a name for our group, the 'Fellowship of the Diamond.' 

After the '8000 Base', a multitude of other bases were created by the 'Fellowship'. A small town called 'Diamond Town' was created in November 2011 with a population of about 8 players. It's notable for being around at the same time as Boatmurdered and we conducted trade with Andrew_Gil at a small trading post in the nether. We created a skybase which we named 'Laputa' after a flying island in Gulliver's Travels. There was the '9x9 Base' which was made with a member of 'Diamond Town' that didn't last too long. All of those bases were griefed shortly after their creation and in January 2012, the '8000 Base' was finally griefed as well. We moved away to our last base, created in September 2012, on a Mushroom Biome. At this point, most of the original members had gotten bored and stopped playing and it was just zhode and I. In October 2012, we left the server and, aside from stopping by to check on some of the older bases in 2013, stopped playing completely.

In March 2015, I discovered James Rustles' 2b2t blog and began reading about all of the things that I had missed out on during my absence. Seeing the server thriving with all of these amazing bases and history inspired me to log in and play again. I managed to convince zhode to play again and brought a new friend, HyraxKing, to help restore the old '8000 Base'. HyaxKing was very productive and created many of the more prominent builds at the base today, such as the pagoda and the stone brick castle. I ended up building the stone brick tower and the tugboat (built in July 2015) that would go on to become synonymous with the base. Eventually, the base got raided and griefed once again and most of the members quit soon after. I moved out and started building a new base in March 2016.

After FitMC made his video about the newly named 'Tugboat Base' in July 2016, I shared it with the older members and it inspired them to play again. We added a new member, KillerCommando29, and they came to the new base and helped to build our largest and most intricate one yet. Most of the members of the revitalized 'Fellowship of the Diamond' have since stopped playing and only occasionally come on to touch up their builds. 



The 'Fellowship of the Diamond' has a long history on the server and has been mostly forgotten to time. A lot of the confusion about this group's history came from it's name. At the same time we were playing, another group began playing and called themselves the 'Brotherhood of the Diamond' and made themselves well known for helping people at spawn. Their name got spread around the server while ours didn't since we usually kept to ourselves. Over time, after our group had been long forgotten, people began to associate the two groups together and crediting the 'Brotherhood' with builds that had been built by the 'Fellowship'. 



It's an easy to mistake to make and a funny coincidence that two different groups came up with such similar names at the same time. The build shown off in FitMC's second video, &quot;The Mystery of the Brotherhood&quot; was not constructed by us and features signs that seem to give a history of the 'Brotherhood of the Diamond'. We never associated or worked with them while we were playing. 



I hope that clears up some misconceptions I've seen about our history. It's been great to see as much interest as there has been about the group and seeing some of our work be talked about to the extent that it has been is very flattering. The 'Fellowship of the Diamond' doesn't look to have much of a future on the server, but it's always possible that one day we shall return full-force to continue making our archaic builds and carrying on our old traditions.

== Relations ==
Since the group mainly kept to themselves, it is safe to say that they were relatively neutral with the much larger groups during the time and in the events of the [[The Facepunch War|Facepunch/4channer Conflict]].

== Trivia ==
Coincidentally enough, around the same time, another group known as the Brotherhood of Diamonds formed.
* Since the two groups were lost to time and information was forgotten, the Brotherhood was credited to have done things that the Fellowship did despite the two being completely different groups and having nothing to do with each other.
* The Brotherhood was more active and made their presence more noticeable than the Fellowship did which contributed to the player confusion.

== Notable Members ==

* zhode (Founder)
* serphantking12 (Founder)
* _ironeagle_ (Founder)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1664">== The Four Corners Pilgrimage ==

[[The Four Corners Pilgrimage]] is the 2b2t term for the trip to each of the four [[Overworld]] corners.
* [[North East Corner]] = 30,000,000 / 0 to 256 / 30,000,000
* [[South East Corner]] = -30,000,000 / 0 to 256 / 30,000, 000
* [[South West Corner]] = -30,000,000 / 0 to 256 / -30,000,000
* [[North West Corner]] = 30,000,000 / 0 to 256 / -30.000.000
Making the trip in the [[End]] has been done before many times, even by [[Youtubers]] like [[Barrendome]], however this is only because of Elytra hacking and is generally not counted as important. The pilgrimage is seen as the older brother of the [[World Border Trip]] as it is roughly 9 times as far and much more difficult. 

Although there is no specific order, many people begin at the North East corner and travel clockwise.If one only counts the distance from the NE corner and moves along the very edge of the border at all times, the distance to travel will be 240,000,000 blocks. If the player uses autowalk and does not come across any obstacles, it would take them over 15,442 hours. However most players will probably elytra hack their way, bringing journey times to over 53 hours (assuming elyta speed is a constant 125 blocks/second).

The first player who is believed to have made this journey is [[iTristan]] who teleported via exploits, which doesn't really count. The same goes for the next person to do this journey, [[pyrobyte]] who also cheated.  However about twenty players excluding those two have made the journey legitimately, left signs and indestructible obsidian marking their achievement at the corners.

'''Breif History'''

The Freelancers were founded in late 2016 by Jin_Masamune and SoloPlayer88. Their group name and activity remained secret and out of the public eye until October of 2017, when they became allied with Emperium. The Freelancers' activities consist of; exploring spawn and the 2b2t world map, looting and protecting coords of 2b2t Monuments, building structures, and increasing friendly relationships between other groups

The Freelancers was the first group to start digging the -Z Highway in the Nether back in 2016 and made several 1 million milestone builds along the way. However, many of these builds have now been griefed.

Jin_Masamune also known by his alt-account 6below is the founder of the group as well as the oldest player of the group having joined the server in mid 2013 during the 2nd Incursion. The Freelancers are more passive than most groups on 2b2t and don't indulge in much PVP Warfare or griefing.

'''Fall of Freelancer HQ'''

On June 20th, 2018. The Freelancer's main base known as HQ was discovered and later destroyed by Retronaunt and his Infrared minons. Because of this, The Freelancers officially declared war and marked Infrared as their first real enemy.

The Fursecutioners are an amorphous group created in the wake of the [[Spawn Incursions|Third Incursion]] by [[DemonElite119]] . It is not a group in the sense of having a set goal or purposes, only that they are a group of people who enjoy basing together or engaging in bamboozles. The vast majority of its members are oldfags and midfags, such as [[Drewbookman]] , [[_Henry_]] , [[Sun_Wukon]] , [[SnackyNorph]] , [[Rickenman]] , [[IamTUNA]] , [[AwesomeGuyMonkey]] , and others.

As the group is amorphous by nature, it's member count is frequently in flux, based on activities individual members are undertaking at the time, or server events such as incursions of which its members have played significant roles in. It adapts based on any given situation, with only a few individuals known to be core members of the group.

Much like its independence-oriented players, the group as a whole is independent and maintains no actual relations with fagtion groups. Every member maintains and exercises their own agendas as long as it does not adversely interfere with another's. The only time its members come out in force as a unified front outside of their individual or group bases is during spawn incursions.

The Guild was a group created by SmackAttack86 and OldFreeWilly. The Purpose of The Guild was to build a new Spawn Base every day and to have fun. Because of this, spawn is often spammed with ruins of old Guild bases.[[File:Guild.png|thumb|201x201px|Also known as The Eye of Proxima, this strange triangle represents The Guild.]]

==The History==

Originally, The Guild was a secret group which very few players knew of. After certain plans within the group fell through, [[SmackAttack86]] (one of the more disliked members of the group) quit and sent rather threatening messages to many of the remaining members. SmackAttack86 ended up rejoining the original Guild later so he could continue to benefit from classified information. 

Believing that the original group had been disbanded, SmackAttack86 set up his own version of The Guild, using the same name in an attempt to draw relevancy to himself. This reincarnation of The Guild is led by OldFreeWilly, who works closely with SmackAttack86. Supposedly, this clone group had been around a few months before it was made public, though evidence shows that this span of time was only 10 days. During this time it housed only a few members and no bases. Almost as soon as SmackAttack86's Guild came to light on October 1st, about 20 players tried to join it, although most of them were trolls and insiders. SmackAttack86 and OldFreeWilly thought up a plan to keep insiders in The Guild, but in a position where they could not do damage. They realized that if they flagged players who seemed suspicious and only sent them on petty tasks to retrieve items and deliver them to random coordinates and never promoted them, then they could waste the time of insiders, while giving them a false sense of belief that their attempt would be successful. Later though, Smack realized that this plan let in to many insiders and not enough loyal members so he scrapped the insider policy. As of November 11th, 2017, not only does The Guild have one of the highest player counts in terms of actual members, but it also has 100+ members in the general chat.  

&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;

==The Fall of The Guild==
The Guild would likely still be here today, if it weren't for the one fatal mistake that they made; trusting [[The Highland]]. The leader of The Highland, Lotus, wanted to use The Guild for one of his twisted experiments. He managed to plant himself into The Guild and deceive [[SmackAttack86]], exposes one of Smack's greatest weaknesses; being gullible as fuck. Lotus managed to work his way up in the ranks until he became Grand Master. Lotus planned to stay in The Guild as he was until Vet Queue got removed, then move to the next phase. The next phase is currently unknown but most people didn't want to stick around to find out. One day, around 12:30PM on December 1st, 2017, Smack got into an argument with Lotus over bossing around other players to which Smack used Lotus' own words &quot;Highland over everything&quot;. This angered Lotus because not only was Smack not brainwashed like the other Highlanders, but he also talked back to him. Lotus threw a temper tantrum and destroyed The Guild beyond repair. It is currently unknown whether The Guild got deleted or it has now reverted back to complete secrecy. The most credible theory is that while it might never see the light of day again, it still stands in the shadows, pulling the strings on 2b2t forever and ever until the end of time. No, obviously I'm kidding. Everyone will be long dead at the &quot;end of time&quot;. But seriously though, next time you're about to dump a pack of TNT over some newfags dupestash, take a closer look. You might just see that metallic triangle, grinning like the Chesire Cat. 

==The System==

Your default rank in The Guild's discord is Void. Void doesn't represent The Guild in any way and you only have access to #the-void which is just a general chat. You can be initiated into The Guild via an interview with any Grandmaster ranked member. Once you are in The Guild there are several ranks that you can go up to from there.

*Knight
*Dragoon

The Holy League was a group with the intention to create an organized community on 2b. The group centered around Christianity but was not taken to a serious degree. The group started during the early days of the Rusher War, however, never really got involved in the conflict.
[[File:IMG 0021.PNG|thumb|200x200px|Holy League Banner]]

== History ==
The Holy League was started in June of 2016 by LiO and AndyCapped. Unlike many of the other groups at the time, the League did not participate in the Rusher War and instead kept to itself. While on the highway, LiO and Andy hired their first recruits. Eventually, they settled down and built their first base, Oasis Town. As the War raged on the group slowly accumulated members and built bases. Many of these bases were near the highways, and were later abandoned. The group also griefed two map arts, one made by doctrzombie and the other by AlphaComputer.  

Eventually, the group went inactive in March of 2017. The first &quot;conflict&quot; the group had was when LiO insulted Tim_mcnukepants of the 4th Reich, a week later. In retaliation, Tim, along with eenmom, and BibleBot blew up the League's incomplete, spawn community base, Constantinople. This was as far as the conflict went and the group went on to dupe a while before going completely inactive. 

== Relations ==
* The group had mostly negative relations with other groups but no conflict ever arose other than the incident with the Reich.

== Notable Members ==
* LiO (Founder)
* AndyCapped (Founder) (First Pope)
* Mavidwaer (Second Pope)
* Aaron
* Pizzaman

The Judge's Group was an old group from 2011 that was relatively well known around the server. The group were amongst the first to be pioneers of group bases, along with the [[Facepunch Republic]],  and the first known group to have made it to 1 million (X:1,000,000 Y: 1,000,000) and build a foothold there. The Judge Group started when [[Offtopia]] and [[THEJudgeHolden]] started to save newfags from spawn and leading them to their new base called [[Oldtown]] . Then Oldtown was attacked and a desperate race started to get as far as possible from [[spawn]] and escape the hackers and griefers back in chaos that was 2b2t in 2012.  Their epic saga is told in the 2b2t comics made by Judge Holden.

== History ==
Around the time THEJudgeHolden first joined 2b2t on an alt account of Offtopia, Judge founded Old Town in April of 2011. Eventually, Judge invited Offtopia to the base and Offtopia proposed the initial idea of the group. The group started to recruit its first members; jdw99666, elocdrof, marksman77, willyroof, bubbakennedy, and square_digger. The group also made Shitpit City at one point. Old Town flourished with visitors and construction project throughout the town. But it was not to last as popbob showed up and destroyed it in November of 2011.

Shortly after, the group moved on to build Ravenholm, an island base, and [[Ravendel]]. The group recruited a few more members at this time. Ravendel was also destroyed by popbob. It was at this point that the group finally decided to head out to 1 million to create 1 mil town. The group also continued to hire more members, chrisleighton being amongst them. Once at 1 million, a few group members

=== '''The Knights of Spawn:''' ===
The Knights of spawn is a small group of players founded by Pharaoh64(formerly CadetDurina) on 6/1/2017 dedicated to helping players at spawn survive and preserving builds on the server. It was annexed by the [[The Emperium]] on about 6/16/2017, joining many of the other groups working in part for The Emperium. While under the control of The Emperium it worked to recruit new players to the group. Around October of 2017, it started losing its momentum as a group and is now considered inactive. Despite this, a few members are still fairly active in The Emperium discord.

'''The Legion of Shenandoah''' was formed in the summer of 2013, after the chaos left by the [[Spawn Incursions|second incursion]] , some of its core members served in the event. They would later meet with other players to form the Legion of Shenandoah. They built bases and acted inspired by the [[Valkyria]]ns . Their admiration later led to a union between what was left of [[Fenrir]] /[[Nova]] and their group, making[[ Asgard II]] happen. The two groups however didn’t totally merge. The Legion agreed to help the “eagle” and follow it to the [[Spawn Incursions|Third Incursion]] but still keeping their independence. Their symbol is a Dragon with open wings, similar to the eagle and their banner is a single diagonal string of green separating red and blue sides.

The Museum, a server open to the public, is a public version of [[Project Vault|The Vault server]]. It was created to show case not only the most iconic builds of [[2b2t]] but also some of the smallest and newest builds. The goal of the museum is to collect and preserve as much of 2b2t's history as possible for future players to visit and hopefully gain inspiration to build and not destroy the rich history of 2b2t.
== History ==
The Museum was created by tomah54660/jddinger, also known as The_Director2b2t on [[Subreddit|Reddit]], who had the idea to create such a server over since 2016 and spent close to a year gathering world downloads. It was created to show case not only the most iconic builds of 2b2t but also some of the smallest and newest builds. It went public on June 14th, 2017.

== Controversy ==
Many oldfriends and midfriends have opposed The Museum due to rumors of the server being an ip grabber. These accusations are based on the fact the /seen [username] command works on the server.

After the events of [[Summermelon]] where [[Fit]] griefed a base that [[Offtopia]] was heavily involved with, [[Rocket Town|Fit's Skybase]] was removed from the Museum, however it was re-added since at /warp RocketTown.

After the grief of Block Game Mecca and CainesLaw's Boedecken, the current owner, Beardler was suspected of leaking the bases' coordinates. This put a negative light on the museum till things were solved.

== Featured Builds ==
* The 10th DonFuer
* [[HardHat's Pyramid]]
* [[Pacific Heights]]
* [[Omega City]]
* [[King's Landing]]
* [[Point Dory]]
* many others

== Trivia ==
* The Museum has many people working in the background to make it possible, from Offtopia who is in constant search of new bases to repair and add to [[THEJudgeHolden]] who is busy creating the new hub and [[hermeticlock]] who created the website.

* The Museum has over 130 world downloads to show case currently with more added daily. It can be found at 2b2tmuseum.com .

* The members of the Museum &quot;guild&quot; range from Old Friends, Middle Friends and New Friends.

* Some of the people who are part of Museum are tomah54660/jddinger, [[Offtopia]], THEJudgeHolden, [[Barrendome]], [[Bigdon|BigDon]], [[Byrnsy]], CainesLaw, Cyto, GrandMaster, [[HermeticLock|hermeticlock]], 2f4u, Joeilk, Niftyrobo, Ross, Vaxent , Willyroof and [[0xymoron]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7495">[[File:Ridealong_feb28_11.jpg|thumb|A screenshot of a room on one of the Nether Highways. It was originally used in a rockpapershotgun article in 2011.]]The Nether is one of the three realms in the Minecraft universe (The others being the [[The Overworld|Overworld]] and the [[The End|End]].) and acts as the game's Hell dimension (or rather, in [[2b2t]]'s case, one of the three hell dimensions). It is accessed by using a [[Portals|Nether portal]], which are generally seen around [[spawn]] abandoned or disabled. Because one block length in the Nether is eight blocks in the overworld, many players generally flock to the Nether's [[highways]] as a main source of travel.

== On 2b2t ==

=== -Spawn ===
Like the overworld and End spawn, the Nether spawn does not always stay the same and is constantly changing as players pass through. The spawn of the 2b2t's Nether is an immense chasm of ever-changing floating bridges and pillars of various blocks that is completely obliterated from the [[bedrock]] roof to the bedrock floor. The bottom is filled with several lava lakes and has a thriving population of withers on the bedrock surface. The vast majority of activity and development occurs just beneath the roof, because tunnels built at the top of the nether cannot be flooded with lava from above. A large platform made mostly from obsidian is usually located at the middle of the nether spawn, which periodically gets damaged, repaired and added on to by various players and groups. Players can almost always be found hanging out here, either to kill other players that try to pass through, or to control the area so they can do what they want with it. Usually both. 

=== -Highways ===
Four highways extend outwards along the x and z axes towards the world border. Closer to spawn, they are very large tunnels with elevated platforms made from a wide variety of different block types, mostly obsidian, running through them. This is due to players using explosives and creating withers within them, which has widened them over the years. For most of their regularly traveled lengths, they are 2 blocks wide and 3 blocks tall, just the right size to ride a horse through. Very, very far out, they become only 1 block wide and 2 blocks tall, so players need to go on foot or ride a pig or boat instead. So far, only two of these highways actually reach the 3,750,000 blocks to the corresponding coordinates of the world border in the overworld: the +X and the +Z. The others are yet to be completed by the dedicated group that builds them. A tunnel that extends 30,000,000 blocks through the nether to the nether world border has yet to be built, or even attempted. 

=== -Uses ===
The Nether is an ideal place for people who want to travel due to the Minecraft mechanic where one block in the Nether equates to eight blocks in the overworld. Portals to the nether are also used for gold farms, in which players create large Nether portals in order for zombie pigmen to emerge from them and fall into a machine that kills them. It is also used for its regular Minecraft purposes such as mining or farming for soul sand, nether bricks, nether quartz, magma blocks, Ghast tears, Nether wart, Blaze rods, magma cream, and sometimes even for Netherrack. Wither skulls are not generally farmed for since they have been [[Duplication Glitches|duped]] thousands of times and Wither Skeletons barely spawn, if at all, due to 2b2t's bad mob spawn rate. The Nether is also host to easy pickings against nakeds or unprepared travelers.

=== -Availability of Items ===
One of the main disadvantages of 2b2t's age is the difficulty of obtaining nether items. Because the server is so old and so thoroughly explored, you have to go really, really far out to find nether fortresses, which only generated after 1.0, and even farther out to find netherquartz, which only generated after 1.5. Naturally generated magma blocks, added in 1.10, are even harder to find, but fortunately, they can be crafted with magma cream, and generate naturally in the underwater trenches in the overworld [that will be] added in 1.13. Netherwart can be farmed anywhere and so is easily obtained, but blaze rods are a different story. And the low spawn rates of ghasts and magma cubes makes getting ghast tears and magma cream more difficult than normal (but not impossible). Of course, wither skulls are almost completely impossible to obtain, even more so than normal, and so players are better off getting them from someone else than trying to get them themselves.

=== -Issues ===
Not as many issues have arisen in the Nether as in the other two dimensions, however, issues have still arisen nonetheless. One of the most common and major issues that [[Hausemaster]] had to deal with over the years was access to the Nether roof. There have been several glitches, exploits, and [[Cheat Clients|hacked clients]] that have allowed players to access the top of the bedrock roof of the Nether over the years. Players would use the nether roof as a place to build stuff that would be inaccessible to most other players (including, in the early days, one of the first [[Duplication Glitches|duping]] machines ever built on the server), and they would also use it to travel long distances through the nether very easily along the entirely flat and featureless bedrock ceiling, rather than having to go to the trouble of tunneling through the nether proper. However, this didn't last, as [[lagfags]] would abuse the flatness of the nether roof and use hacked clients to run extremely fast through the nether and load copious amounts of chunks very quickly in order to seriously lag the server. This eventually prompted Hausemaster to close the Nether's rooftop entirely by installing a plugin that would teleport anyone who got above level 127 back down below the roof.

== Trivia ==
* The nether receives plenty of traffic every day, especially along the main highways, because of how convenient it is for fast travel. The spawn in particular receives very heavy traffic, with it being a very common occurrence to encounter someone there. The &quot;nether hub&quot; is considered by many to be the most dangerous place on the server simply because it is the site of the most player activity (and because it overlies a 100+ block drop into a wither-infested magma-covered jagged floor of indestructible rock).
* Despite (or perhaps, because of) this traffic, not many people actually build in the Nether, and mostly prefer to build in the overworld (or occasionally the end).
* If you (try to) sleep in a bed in the nether, a [[Suicide Bombing (Crystal/Bed Bombing)|bed bomb]] will occur. This is one of the reasons the nether is more dangerous than the overworld, as beds can be used by suicide bombers, which are easily obtained and don't have to be placed on obsidian, as opposed to end crystals. 
* There was a time in which players using elytra hacks would fly under the nether floor to travel rapidly through the nether, entering and exiting through holes in the bottom bedrock layer opened up through exploits or hacks. As long as players stuck close to the floor, they would not take void damage. This caused just as much lag as when players would run across the top of the nether roof in the past, forcing Hausemaster to install a plugin that would automatically close all holes in the nether's bottom bedrock layer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1536">== The North Pole ==

=== Idea ===
The idea was that the base was going to be built from July to December 2017. The base was going to be the largest Christmas base on the server. Most bases would decorate their bases for Christmas, while this base would have been an ongoing project throughout 6 months until the big reveal. Many people would have been invited one in specific being [[Jared2013]] . 

=== Downfall: ===
The North Pole was compromised due to lack of trust between Killet, HowsItGoing, and the rest of the members... The distrust caused the other members to go behind Killet and HowsItGoing's back by destroying the base before Killet or HowsItGoing could even think about doing anything to the base.

=== Members ===
The North Pole was a base created by iTavux, HowsItGoing, Jumbo Warrior, Enjoy, http_logan, Killet, Surviverkiller, Negative_Entropy and a few others who attended the base

== ''The Story of Paragon as told by Sage_Mathias:'' ==
[[File:Image3.jpg|thumb|450x450px|centre]]
[[File:Image2.jpg|thumb|450x450px|centre]]&quot;I was at my group base Valinor when my friend Rpb7191, whom I’ve based with before, messaged me saying he had a good location for a base and he was wondering if I would like to come base with him. I agreed to, and started packing up all my gear in shulkers and prepared myself to /kill to spawn, rpb7191 seemed like he was in a rush so I barely got everything done that I needed to do before leaving. As I arrived at spawn it took me a little while to find a portal, but when I did, I just started walking down the highway to the coords rpb7191 had given. It took me a couple times until I arrived at the location, rpb7191 had built some chests so around it I built the first cottage of the Paragon. Rpb7191 came on a few times after that and made goals for us, but then he left 2b2t. I began to make the road through town. It was at the road that lead me to finding my neighbors AlienAgent124 and Scully__ the builders of Cobbletown. I bred a donkey with their horse and got a mule, which I named Shifter’s son after his Father, the horse named Shifter. I built the +1 Extra Life Storage facility and started farming crops and breeding livestock. I Added some paths around the area and landscaped the sides of the road with petunias and oak leaves. Next I built the gatehouse and additional road running perpendicular to the main road, and I also expanded the walls on each side of the road for the entire length of road systems. It was at this time I made the Paragon banner, an orange cross on a white background. This was to symbolize the colors of the sandstone and acacia wood I used to build everything. The name Paragon was suggested by Rpb7191 and I agreed that’s what we would call the base. I built the small guest cottage and made some tree farms for wood supplies. Then I decided I would expand across the bay to the land beyond it. I began by building the docks and a small hut that I used for afk fishing. Next I built the Longhouse and started working on the library and a bridge to connect them to the rest of town. I had done an immense amount of leveling of the terrain, and continued to build the roads out. It was at this point I was done building and decided to leave, I went to the top of orthanc tower and set flight with my elytra, I flew over the south canal and all the way to [[Sniper's Peaceful Island]] where I met Auchzezt and he gave me a replacement elytra as mine was in need of mending.&quot;

&quot; I rested there and when I was ready to leave I had to set out on foot, [[Hause]] had disabled elytra. I made my journey home to Valinor and I told friends to visit Paragon ELVeng a member of Sniper's island went there and Myne1001 visited as he and Thebes were repairing the canal after hhh1 had griefed it. I invited a few new players to Paragon but none came. Then a friend by the name of Mr Butterman became one of the only other members of Paragon, he built a lovely horse stable and went out on his own after getting some simple supplies from the storage area.&quot;

&quot;Time passed on and I did not go back to Paragon, I met Drewbot9000 and told him of Paragon, and he went there to check on it. It was still in good shape at the time, and he went on to find a home at Peaceful Island. Other new players visited, but I was unaware, and it was at this time Team Inferno discovered the base and decided to inhabit it and redesign the Desert temple which inspired the theme of the base's sandstone and orange acacia wood architecture. Retronaux, the leader of Team Inferno, would invite members of his faction to base there and they began to migrate and build simple things all of which I was unaware of as I was back at Valinor at the time around December 2017. A few more random visitors came and then unfortunately things started to go badly for the base. A powerful group known as the Emperium had been secretly insiding the Team Inferno, and when they saw Paragon as a base on their factions list they decided to target it. They came and blew up the Paragon not knowing it was founded by me, Sage_Mathias, thinking it was a Team Inferno Base. This would have happened around January 5th 2018. I decided to set a pearl at Valinor and head to spawn January 15th and after visiting the Beta Isles, built by Kyle_Raynor_Ion, 0xymoron and it’syoungdaddy I figured I’d check out my old base Paragon and see if it was still in one piece. I met some nice players on my journey through the greater spawn area. Patrick Sherlock of Goodwill Bazaar and I visited a sanctuary named Pumpkin King Farm, giving them a few items. When I finally got to Paragon I saw the state it was in January 18 2018 it was in ruins.&quot;

==Description==

The paragon was actually two bases: Paragon itself, a town made primarily from sandstone and acacia wood, situated between a desert and swamp, and Cobbletown, an older base made mostly from cobblestone and oak wood, in a plains biome to the south. The two bases were built in close proximity by accident and sort of merged once they discovered each other.

Paragon was a collection of detailed, medium-sized buildings connected by cobblestone and dirt path roadways, each with a slightly different design scheme. A large sandstone roadway ran north to south through the middle of it. Cobbletown consisted of a few small buildings connected by dirt paths, plus a few large buildings, including an arena and a tower to the height limit. An underground hall and a large hole were located to the south.

==Trivia==
* Contrary to popular belief, Paragon/Cobbletown was not built by [[Infrared]] , but rather a group of independent players that preceded them. The base was later discovered and occupied by team Infrared (called Inferno at the time) as they were given the impression by one of their members that he had built it himself, and it was later griefed by [[The Emperium]], who thought the base had been founded by Inferno/infrared.
* The first structure built at Cobbletown was created on may 28th of 2016, just four days before [[TheCampingRusher]] first joined.
* Then Sage_Mathias and Rpb7191 came and based with Sage and they developed the paragon. Paragon was indeed a beautiful base of its scale.

[[File:Minecraft banner 97g95bz9v converted.png|thumb|240x240px|Peacekeeper Banner]]
'''The Peacekeepers''' are a group on 2b2t that started on July 8th, 2016 when

PandaSauceYT started a series on his channel with the word &quot;peacekeepers&quot; in each episode. The group was originally based on the idea of [[Team Equinox]], as the original idea for the Peacekeepers was to essentially &quot;keep the peace&quot; and attack both [[Team Rusher]] and [[Team Veteran]]. As [[The Rusher War]] escalated, the Peacekeepers began gaining attention as a legitimate group by both [[Team Rusher|Rushers]] and [[Team Veteran|Veterans]]. Eventually, the Peacekeepers ditched their third team/neutrality ideology and sided with [[Team Rusher]]. The Peacekeepers essentially became somewhat of a sub group of [[Team Rusher]] as Napkin0fTruth, [[TheCampingRusher|Rusher's]] faction friend and rival, decided to defect from [[Team Veteran]] to Peacekeepers. From then on, the two teams essentially worked together and Rusher gained his first god gear from a Peacekeeper dupe stash, given to him by Napkin.

== Post-War ==
[[File:Imageedit 10 8367309629.png|thumb|221x221px|Peacekeeper Bird]]
The Peacekeepers are the last remaining (active) Pro-Rusher group to still roam the server after the war, playing a key role in [[The Three Way War|Reich vs Aurora vs PK war.]] They are enemies with both [[The 4th Reich]] and [[Team Aurora]], as they fight, grief, and skirmish against each other.

When the mini war ended after the 5th Incursion, the group eventually   
left the server for about 4-5 months, which led to many to believe that the group died. However, PandasauceYT simply did what Neda T did in which he brought his group to other servers. Panda also started his own server where him and his peacekeeper buddies hang out.  
[[File:Capture-1497980472.PNG|thumb|194x194px|Custom Flag]]
[[File:New PK flag.png|thumb|220x220px|The new updated Peacekeeper Flag.]]
Eventually, on March 19th, 2017, PandasauceYT and the rest of the peacekeeper hierarchy returned to 2b2t. They currently PvP at spawn and talk in chat. Bitterness between the Peacekeepers and Aurora continued as PandaSauce and others were talking trash about Aurora and Aurora retaliated with griefing one of their bases. This base was insided but was empty and no one cared for it. The group decided to make a small spawn base but was griefed. Members continue to regularly play on 2b2 [[File:Capture33.PNG|thumb|323x323px|Second Banner]]During Summer 2017, the Peacekeepers fought the Spawn Masons at spawn quite often. The first battle occurred on June 4th 2017, they ambushed torogadude at spawn causing him  to log, eventually resulting in a huge fight between both groups. However, the Spawn Masons retreated because FitMC (also streaming at the time and joined the fight) had to go because he had &quot;stuff to do in real life&quot;. Both sides claimed victory, the Spawn Masons claimed victory because their main goal was to get toro to safety and the Peacekeepers claimed victory because the masons retreated. When the Spawn Masons disbanded in August 2017 due to inside conflicts, the Peacekeepers were pretty dominant over spawn, they changed their ranking system and kicked a large portion of members. 

A small conflict began to build up with Highland after the disbandment of the Spawn Masons. The Peacekeepers disliked a leader of Highland at the time, DieloTai for shittalking the group and simply because Highland was (and still is) very attention seeking. No battles were fought at spawn, the only time these groups fought each other was when Highland deliberately gave up their spawn camp coordinates so they could move and make a new one. The Peacekeepers arrived at the base while they were all afk, this resulted in a fight at the camp and Highland loosing, all members were killed except for DieloTai who cowardly ran away and PK sustained no casualties.

PK became ghosts after that, many members became inactive or quit 2b2t and those who remained went solo. IHackedWalmart (already a high ranking member in PK) helped Metrez and many others dig the -x highway in late 2017. In early 2018 AlphaCentauriA1 made a group for the remaining active members, the Saviours, he also made IHackedWalmart a leader of this group. The Saviours did not last long at all, the discord became inactive quite quickly because everyone joined the recently reformed Team Inferno, now Infrared that IHackedWalmart was a co leader of, the saviours discord was deleted two months later for seeing little to no activity. The Peacekeepers joined the Alpha Alliance, Infrared, Highland and PK were the first three groups in the Alliance, it was made to rival the United Group Embassy. Highland and PK allied due to this common enemy and put their old past behind them.

The Alpha Alliance welcomed smaller groups such as Team Virus and Team Rainbow. The Alliance never actually accomplished much on the 2b2t main map but on the march 2018 temp map the Alliance was successful in attacking an Emperium skybase with only 3 people, JcTheLime, IHaxedWindowsXP and Metrez and were able to accomplish more. The Alpha Alliance fell almost two months after it's creation, the discord is still up now. Afterwards, the Peacekeepers were no longer allied with highland and kept it's strong relations to Infrared.[[File:2b2t-symbol orig.png|thumb|274x274px|Peacekeeper symbol]]

== Relations ==
* [[Team Rusher]] - The relation between Peacekeepers and [[Team Rusher]] was very strong due to [[TheCampingRusher|Rusher's]] factions friend and rival, Napkin0fTruth, joined the team. Napkin claimed that the Peacekeepers were 90% with [[Team Rusher|Rushers]] and 10% with [[Team Veteran|Veterans]].
* [[Team Veteran]] - Despite Napkin's claim of the Peacekeepers being 10% with the Veterans, the [[Team Veteran|Veterans]] considered them as an enemy. [[Team Veteran]] especially wanted revenge on Napkin for ditching their group.
* [[Team Resistance]] - The relation between the two teams remained relatively neutral throughout the war until about the end of the war when Napkin had a dispute with the [[Team Resistance|Resistance]] member GoDzOneManArmy. The dispute resulted in some bitterness between the two, however no sort of attacks have been conducted against each other.
* [[Team Aurora]] - Team Aurora instigated attacks against the Peacekeepers after the Rusher War as Team Aurora was a pro-Veteran group and the Peacekeepers were a pro-Rusher group. The group dragged the Peacekeepers into a [[The Three Way War|Three Way War]] along with the 4th Reich. The two groups were due to be allies with the agreement of the Triple Treaty between Team Aurora, Peacekeepers, and [[The Blind Eye Clan]] (which used to be Ragnarok) against the 4th Reich. However, this was interrupted by the 4th Reich and the two continued to be enemies. When the Peacekeepers returned in March of 2017, they continued this enmity with Team Aurora as they conducted a raid against each other.
* [[The 4th Reich]] - The two groups were enemies since the Peacekeepers sided with the [[Team Rusher|Rushers]] and they continued to fight after [[The Rusher War]]. The Peacekeepers are currently in a three way war between [[The 4th Reich]] and Team Aurora. The Peacekeepers, however are now allies with The 4th Reich.
* [[Team V Fawkes (VTV)]] - Team V Fawkes started out as an Anti-Rusher group until they decided to merge with the Peacekeepers after the war.
* [[The Blind Eye Clan]] (was Ragnarok) - Peacekeepers were allies with Team Ragnarok, due to the Triple Treaty between [[Team Aurora]], Peacekeepers, and [[The Blind Eye Clan]] (which used to be Ragnarok). However, the clan disbanded when the treaty failed after 4th Reich intervention.
* [[Spawn Masons]] - Peacekeepers are enemies with the Spawn Masons due to oldfag hate from [[The Rusher War|the Rusher War.]]
*[[The Emperium]] - despite several fights between both groups, they still remain relatively neutral. However, the Peacekeepers did join the Alpha Alliance and help fight the Emperium. During the march 2018 temporary map the Emperium launched a surprise attack on a PK skybase resulting in a small battle, the base was griefed in the end. Now they are somewhat enemies.
*Infrared - Peacekeepers seem to have very strong relations to Infrared due to PK members such as IHackedWalmart, IHaxedWindowsXP, OldFreeWilly and more being part of Infrared. Due to the inactivity of PK many active PK members decided to join Infrared because IHackedWalmart (high ranking member of PK) being a co leader of this group. Infrared fought alongside PK during the Alpha Alliance (now fallen) during the march 2018 tempmap. 
*Highland - The Peacekeepers disliked Highland for a long time, after the Spawn masons got disbanded more tension between the two groups built up. However, no real battles were fought between the two groups at spawn, the only battle fought between the groups was when the Peacekeepers found their spawn camp and obliterated it and killed all the members sustaining no casualties. The two groups were allied for almost two months, both joined the Alpha Alliance to rival the United Group Embassy, now the Alpha Alliance has fallen and Highland betrayed Infrared, PK and Highland are now neutral. 

== Trivia ==
* The peacekeepers are the last active pro-rusher group to exist after the Rusher War. They are also the longest lasting as they have been in existence for 9 months, while the rest died out about a month after the war ended.
* Grew to become one of the most hated groups on the server
* The peacekeepers, along with Aurora, have spread their influence to other servers.
* The peacekeeper ranking system changed from a tier/level based system (i.e. Tier I/Level I) to a member based one (Member, Elite, Leader, etc.)
* The Peacekeepers were considered to be around the second strongest group on the server, now it's hardly considered. 
* There were several other groups that called themselves peacekeepers during the Rusher War, however, Pandasauce's turned out to be the strongest and the one that lasted the entirety of the war, outliving and merging many of the neutral groups into it.
* Before 2b2t PandaSauceYT owned a Minecraft server named AncientArk, after his join of 2b PandaSauceYT deleted all known videos of AncientArk on his youtube account and also closing down the server (he has plans to re open it)

The Pyylaandia were a old Finnish raider group on 2b2t, existing during the [[Facepunch Republic|Facepunch times.]] The group was notorious for its constant raids of the [[NFE]]. 

== History ==
Not much is known about this group due to time, however, what is known is that this group was a powerhouse as they had access to inventories of TNT. This made the group a formidable force to reckon with during those times. After several attacks on the NFE, xcc2 and policemike55 decided to investigate how they were getting this much TNT. In the spring of 2013, Xcc2 and policemike55 eventually found out how they were creating the TNT, which turned out to be a gunpowder grinder in which the group would constantly be AFK at. The two eventually killed all the AFK members and blew up their grinder. This was the last mention of the Pyylaandia since.

'''The Resistance''' is a group on 2B2T. It was founded by [[CorruptedUnicorn]] on June 22nd, 2016. Their goal was to become as powerful as they possibly could. The group was hated by both old and new players and became infamous due to the griefing of [[the Valley of Wheat]] . They are known for being ruthless and using superior numbers to overwhelm foes. Sato86 himself was forced to combat log against a group of them. Although often refered to as a [[Team Rusher|Rusher]] subgroup, the two are in fact separate organizations with a common enemy. The main difference between the two is that Resistance members have minimal interest in the server's history, and would rather grief, unlike [[Team Rusher|Rushers]], who seemed to dislike the Resistance as a result. NedaT was believed to be a Resistance member until mid-August, 2016 when she revealed to be a [[Team Veteran]] spy.
== Relations ==
* [[Team Rusher]] - The relation with Team Rusher throughout the war was very &quot;shaky&quot; between the two according to Rusher. The teams would flip flop between being allies, to neutral, to even enemies during the Largest Battle of Spawn, in which CorruptedUnicorn fought against [[TheCampingRusher|Rusher]] with [[Fit|FitMC]] due to Fit inviting Corrupted to fight with him before Rusher and also to take revenge for a dispute between Napkin0fTruth and GoDzOneManArmy. However, throughout the entirety of the war, both did share common enemies and can be considered Pro-Rusher in values.
* [[Team Veteran]] - The Resistance were large enemies of [[Team Veteran]] in which many small skirmishes, raids, and large fights were exchanged between the two. This lead [[Team Veteran]] to claim that the Resistance was a Rusher subgroup as the group formed at the start of the Rusher War in which the Resistance denied. Team Veteran most notorious plot to try and destroy the Resistance was sending Neda T as a spy in order to discover one of their dupe stashes.
* [[Team Aurora]] - The Resistance is enemies with [[Team Aurora]] due to their leader's, Neda T, betrayal and because of their Pro-Veteran nature.
* [[The 4th Reich]] - While skirmishes between the two groups were minimal, the two groups were technically enemies due to the difference in beliefs as [[The 4th Reich]] was Pro-Veteran
* Guardian Rushers - The Resistance were allies with the Guardian Rushers as interactions between TheJadyha and different members of the group, mainly Neda T and PvP_Comboz before their defection, were very peaceful.

== Post-War ==
Towards the end of the war, Team Resistance suddenly vanished from the server. CorruptedUnicorn made a video discussing what happened to the Resistance. The group did not disband due to the Veteran attacks but rather the boredom of many of the important members. CorruptedUnicorn was technically the last member active until eventually he moved on as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1548">{{The Rusher Massacre|title1 = The Rusher Massacre|date = June 9, 2016 - September 2016|casualties = 10,400 documented Rusher deaths}}The Rusher Massacre refers to a genocide of [[TheCampingRusher]]'s fans, as a response by [[Team Veteran]] to the swarm of new players that attacked [[2b2t]] as his command. The massacre started on June 9th, 2016 when [[FitMC]] made a video murdering [[Team Rusher|Rushers]] at [[Spawn]]. This led to more videos of his killings, such as the 3v40 raid on June 13th, which was a raid led by Fit, [[Jared2013]], and [[Babbaj]] against a large Rusher [[Sanctuaries|base]].

This also led to a lockdown in Spawn, with spawn patrols being led by Veterans (mostly Fit) to hunt for Rushers. This, along with the veterans' removal of resources such as trees and [[Melons|melon]] farms from the vicinity of spawn, made escaping spawn a near-impossible task, even to other players who weren't involved with the war.

As of October 9th, 2016 Fit declares that there are around 10,400 documented Rusher deaths. This becomes the largest massacre in 2b2t.

== Controversies ==
The Rusher Massacre was more than a massacre of Rusher fans. Every single nakedfag in spawn was considered a Rusher, no matter their alignment. Of course, to those who were dedicated enough to keep trying until they slipped past the veterans' defenses, and to those who considered themselves allied with the veterans and didn't mind being killed as long as it meant rushers were being killed too, this didn't really matter.

'''The Rusher War''' was a major conflict on 2b2t that took place during the 
summer of 2016 and ending in mid-fall in 2016. The war was apparently revolutionary as it gave the server a long needed revival (some say a little too much of a revival) as the server was becoming very empty, and changing the way 2b2t will be played for a very long time. The war was mainly between [[Team Rusher]] and [[Team Veteran]], however they were also some smaller groups involved in the war. The war took place from June 13th to October 9th.

== Background ==
On June 1st, 2016, the youtuber known as [[TheCampingRusher]], with almost a million subscribers, posted a video about 2b2t. The video sparked a massive rush to the server as Rusher's fans flooded the server. The flooding was so large that the already worn down server could not handle it and so lead to massive TPS/lag drops and even crashes. Eventually [[Hause Master]] noticed this massive popularity and had to change the server to a temporary map and added a queue system. The oldfags began to be angry with this large wave of newfags joining the server and so the early sparks of the war began with massacres throughout spawn on these newfags. On June 4th, 2016, Rusher declared war on the oldfags in which he called &quot;OGs&quot; and established [[Team Rusher]]. June 13th, 2016 can be called the first day of the War as on this day, the player known as [[Fit]] or FitMC (youtube channel) was chosen to be leader of [[Team Veteran]] as he posted a massacre of 40 Rushers and many other Anti-Rusher videos before. On July 17th, 2016, a war meeting was conducted by the newly founded [[Team Veteran]] which assembled many if not all the old players.The war continued on the original map of 2b2t and the queue system was given an upgrade by [[TheCampingRusher|Rusher]] himself, who contributed and donated to the server as he felt a bit guilty for flooding the server.

== Major Battles and Events ==
Note: Keep in mind that many minor battles and skirmishes have occurred throughout the course of the war. Also keep in mind that the majority of these events were shown in YouTube drama.
* '''Rusher Declaration of War''' - Rusher officially declared war on June 4th, 2016 on the &quot;OGs&quot;.
* '''Largest Single Massacre on 2b2t '''- On June 13th, 2016, Fit posted a video where he, Babbaj, and jared2013 attacked a large rusher sanctuary with approximately 40 Rushers the day before. All of them were killed in the 3v40 and this caused the initial attention of Fit and lead to his inauguration.[[File:WTlvHxt.png|thumb|192x192px|Rusher talking of war in public chat. ]]
* '''Fit's inauguration'''- Fit was inaugurated to become Team Veteran's leader after he posted several videos about him massacring Rushers. This was on June 13th, 2016, and can be considered the first day of the war as the two official groups began fighting.
* '''Team Veteran War Meeting''' - This meeting assembled several oldfags together to fight for the Veteran initiative. This was on July 17th, 2016
* '''The Lava Cast''' - The Lava Cast was the first attempt to control the massive flood of [[Team Rusher|Rushers]] at spawn by the [[Team Veteran|Veterans]]. The original idea was to make a large lava wall around a 500 radius of spawn which was supposed to kill and stop [[Team Rusher|Rushers]] from escaping spawn. The attempt later failed as many Rushers were finding holes and creating passages through the wall. During the War, the unfinished wall was griefed and created into a large cobble monster.
* '''Rusher Paradise Raid''' - On June 22nd, 2016, [[Team Veteran]] found [[TheCampingRusher|Rusher's]] first attempt to create a base after being on the run for a month. The [[Team Veteran|Veterans]] completely lava casted the Paradise.

* '''Operation Poseidon''' - Operation Poseidon was the second attempt to keep the [[Team Rusher|Rushers]] at spawn by the [[Team Veteran|Veterans]]. The operation was to flood the entirety of spawn with large amounts of water, making it more difficult to navigate spawn and to drown [[Team Rusher|Rushers]]. The operation failed as people with frostwalker (later patched by [[Hause Master]]) began to freeze up the water and others began to clog the water flow. The biomes around spawn also contributed to the failure as their is a large tundra biome near spawn that froze a lot of water.

* '''The Bombing of Spawn''' - The bombing of spawn was the third and final attempt to keep the Rushers at spawn by the Veterans. The bombing was supposed to obliterate spawn, making it much more difficult to navigate through than it already was. The [[Team Veteran|Veterans]] used slime and redstone block airships that dropped an infinite amount of duped TNT that could obliterate any area all the way to bedrock. The [[Team Veteran|Veterans]] managed to completely destroy the nether spawn, however they shortly abandoned the operation due to the start of [[End Crystal suicide bombers|Crystal]]/bed bombing, causing spawn to become too dangerous and players easily able to grief the airships.
* '''Crystal Islands Compromise''' - On July 15th, 2016, Rusher visited an important [[Team Veteran]] spawn outpost known as the Crystal Islands. The [[Team Veteran|veterans]] abandoned the base because they knew it was compromised and the Islands were eventually griefed. It was later known that Fit gave the coords of the Crystal Islands to Rusher.
* '''Destruction of the Valley of Wheat''' - On July 16th, 2016, the Valley of Wheat has been griefed, and the blame is put on TheCampingRusher. Later on it is revealed that CorruptedUnicorn and the Resistance did this. Following this event, the mass majority of the community bashed him for what he did.
* '''The 4th Incursion''' - The Fourth Incursion began on July 24th, 2016, where [[Fit]] declared the invasion of spawn and had Sato86 as the head of the Incursion. During the Incursion, large amounts of [[Team Rusher|Rushers]] were killed and several enemy bases were griefed by [[Team Veteran]]. However the Incursion ended in disaster for [[Team Veteran]] due to them giving newbz crystals to kill people on their bounty list. On September 6th, 2016, FitMC declared the 4th Incursion officially over as Sato86 disappeared from the server and spawn was becoming too dangerous because of the large amounts of [[End Crystal suicide bombers|crystal]]/bed bombers. '''(NOTE: The 4th Incursion and the Rusher War are two completely different entities.)'''
* '''Largest Raid on 2b2t''' - This raid kicked off the 4th Incursion and so happened on July 24th as well. The raid was on Napkin0fTruths old spawn base and a [[Resistance]] dupe stash. 14 people took part in the raid.
* '''4 vs 15 Spawn Battle''' (second largest battle on 2b2t)- During the height of the War, a large battle occurred at spawn on July 28th between [[Team Veteran]] and [[The Resistance]] where 4 Resistance members faced off against 15 Veterans. The battle grew so large that other members from other groups joined the fight (example: UnstoppableRageTrain). The battle ended with a dispute on who won the battle until both teams moved on.
* '''The Destruction of [[Aureus City]]''' - On July 31st, 2016, [[Team Veteran]] was forced to destroy [[Aureus City]] as the coordinates had been compromised by the infamous CancerChan who acted as a girl to convince SnackyNorph that he was his girlfriend. Snacky gave the coords to CancerChan who later gave the coords to [[TheCampingRusher|Rusher]].
* '''Napkin-GoDz Drama''' - On August 1st, 2016, GoDz saw Napkin0fTruth and WildX in a base near spawn and met with them. This was an ambush, and a player attacked GoDz without protection from Napkin0fTruth and WildX, who were murdering newfags at the time, leading GoDz to believe that Napkin0fTruth betrayed him.
* '''[[Fit-Rusher Duel]]''' - On August 5th, 2016, a duel between [[Fit]] and [[TheCampingRusher|Rusher]] was scheduled at the Dark Souls Castle. [[Fit]] ended up being the victor by killing [[TheCampingRusher|Rusher]].
* '''The Torogadude Incident''' - On August 19th, 2016, Torogadude was stripped of his priority queue status, which is owned by Rusher. Prior to this, rumors started going up that Hause Master sold the server out to TheCampingRusher and gave him control of the queue. This caused commotion in the community, because it went against the structure of an anarchy server, which is that players cannot be stripped or banned no matter what they do.
* '''The Largest Battle In 2b2t History''' '''(The Battle of Spawn) '''- This battle was the last battle of the Rusher war and happened on September 16th, 2016. It was originally between [[Team Rusher]] and [[Team Veteran|Veteran]], however members of other groups joined in the fight. [[Team Veteran]] made an alliance with [[The Resistance]] against [[TheCampingRusher|Rusher]], however [[CorruptedUnicorn]] was the only member at that point. The war was supposedly 30 [[Team Veteran|Veterans]] vs 3 [[Team Rusher|Rushers]] however the war became a mess where everyone was fighting everyone.
* '''Battle Against Bed Bombers '''- On September 17th, 2016, a minor yet important battle occurred between [[Team Veteran]], a bed/crystal bomber group, and a few [[Peacekeepers]]. This battle exterminated the bomber group and lessened the amount of suicide bombers around spawn. However, many independent bed bombers are still present around spawn to this day. The change in PVP style also spawned a small meme based off of a forward operations base named Baghdad [http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/Greetings_From_Baghdad]

== End of the War ==
The Rusher War ended when [[TheCampingRusher]] left the server for about two months with no activity on it at all. [[Fit|FitMC]] declared the war officially over on October 9th, 2016, obviously claiming that Team Veteran was victorious. However, Rusher did return but did not instigate a war, meaning his departure was not an armistice. In terms of victor, neither side really won the war. In fact, it wasn't the dominance of one group over the other that ended the war, but rather the boredom of players, the lessening popularity, and the increase of suicide bombers. The suicide bombers ended up being the biggest mistake that [[Team Veteran]] created during the war. [[Team Veteran]] began to administer End Crystals to newfags so they can instantly kill people on Team Veteran's bounty list. This backfired as many newbz began killing [[Team Veteran|Veterans]], [[Team Rusher|Rushers]], and anyone else wearing god gear.

Both teams failed their objectives in a way during the war. [[Team Veteran]] managed to exterminate many [[Team Rusher|Rushers]] and lessen the wait line in the queue but by the end of the war, many [[Team Rusher|Rushers]] escaped spawn and are scattered throughout the server and it still took over 2 hours to get on the server after the whole fiasco. The Team also failed because many oldfags disagreed with the group entirely. They also failed to kick Rusher off the server as he came back and stated that he did not leave due to Team Veteran (in fact it was the reason he kept playing) and that he was simply running out of ideas for the series. He then simply ended the series on October 22nd, 2016, marking the end of the Rusher Period. [[Team Rusher]] failed as [[TheCampingRusher|Rusher]] never set up an official base, failing to prevent his group from griefing, and never really getting involved with other groups to defeat [[Team Veteran]]. Overall, it was boredom, the beginning of school, and suicide bombers that ended the war.

However, the Rusher problem took care of itself, because after Rusher left, the server's population began to decrease. Rusher did eventually come back to the server when the war was declared over and made a final 3 videos (''for more information on the subject matter see the [[Rusher Era]] page). ''However, these videos did not re-instigate a new war.

=== The Rusher Massacre ===
''For more information, go to [[The Rusher Massacre]]''

There was a massive slaughter of newfags by Team Veteran over the course of the Rusher War. The amount of Rushers killed is estimated to be 10,400 based on documented evidence. There may have been more Rusher kills that were undocumented throughout the server.

== Major Groups Involved ==
* [[Team Rusher]] - A group created by [[TheCampingRusher]] who fought against the [[Team Veteran|Veterans]] as they declared that they were on the server not to grief and to simply enjoy and be in awe of the wonders and incredible builds (that [[TheCampingRusher|Rusher]] called &quot;monuments&quot;) on 2b2t. The group was mainly composed of Rusher's fans and other newfags known as &quot;Rushers&quot;.
* [[Team Veteran]] - A group created by the oldfags of the server who fought against the [[Team Rusher|Rushers]] as they feared that their &quot;monuments&quot; would be griefed by them. They also fought against them due to the queue system and large flood of players that kept producing large amounts of lag. The group was mainly composed of oldfags and midfags, with some newfags being hired, known as &quot;Veterans&quot;. However, most of these newfags only joined because of Fit's ruse during the tempmape and were killed later on.

== Other Groups Involved ==
* [[Peacekeepers]] (Team Equinox/Neutrality) - Originally intended to be a &quot;neutral&quot; side of the war and to keep the peace on the server by fighting both sides (hence the name). Eventually, the group became allied with Team Rusher.
* [[Resistance|The Resistance]] - Often thought of as an ally of Team Rusher, the Resistance was the cause of the destruction of the Valley of Wheat.
* [[The 4th Reich]] - A group known for multiple griefs and destruction throughout the course of the war. They were often thought of as an ally of Team Veteran and were known to dumpster multiple Rusher and pro-Rusher bases.
* [[The Vortex Coalition]] - Joined the conflict early on, initially being anti Rusher but eventually becoming neutral.
* [[Team Aurora]] - Created after NedaT was exposed as a Resistance insider and leaked dupe stashes to Veteran members and joined the war towards the end being an anti Rusher group.
* Several other small fagtions and groups

== Legacy ==
Although highly controversial, the Rusher War remains as one of the greatest periods in 2b2t history. It changed the way the game was played and left its mark for years to come. It was the cause of several other events such as the Fourth Incursion. It is also the most documented era of 2b2t, and the most important question is whether or not 2b2t will die down once again, or 2b2t will be like this for years to come.

''&quot;June 1st, 2016 will be forever known as the day that 2b2t changed forever. TheCampingRusher coming on 2b2t was the most significant event in the server's history. There is no longer any denying that.&quot;''
&lt;blockquote&gt;''-Fit, October 9th, 2016.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;Several people, including oldfags, believed that, in a way, the war saved the server as it gave it a new breath of life (which was later found out to be the true goal of Team Veteran). During the spring of 2016, the server was experiencing one of its lowest points as many players left due to the [[Backdoors|backdoor]] scandal of late 2015. Oldfags claim that [[Offtopia]] was literally paying the fees for the server in order for it to survive. This eventually changed when summer rolled around and massive swarms of players joined the server, in which donations and the [[queue]] began to help the server get off its knees.

The 2b2t community has recently witnessed the 1 year anniversary of the Rusher War and the various forms of 2b2t media posted memoires, memes, and shitposts relating to the war. Rusher did not return, which to many, was a relief. 

== Issues/Drama ==
To many of the oldfags, midfags and some newfags, the war was viewed as simply a role-playing war and that the war was simply a publicity stunt to get more attention on the server. The objective of Team Veteran to exterminate Rushers and get them off the server was also contested. After mass suspicion and theories, Veteran leadership eventually began to implicate or blatantly admit the true interior motive post war. The true purpose of Team Veteran was to solely trick the Rushers into believing there was a &quot;war&quot; and to take advantage of the YouTube hype in order to revive the dying server. Team Veteran essentially fueled the war and made it much worse than it actually was in order to keep the YouTube attention from the multiple YouTuber's logging on. Some players even believe that Rusher himself was actually involved in the whole scheme in order to have content for his videos.

This does not mean, however, that there would not have been any true conflict between Rushers and players who actually wanted to get them off the server. This also does not mean that Rusher would not have made a series on the server, however, without the fueling of Team Veteran, the war in itself would have been much shorter and Rusher's series would have ended much earlier.

Months after the war, the &quot;war&quot; simply became a meme, often being asked by newfags if there is still a war, to which the regulars would often respond jokingly and offensively.

== Trivia ==
* The first usages of Crystal/bed Bombing was used during this war, changing warfare on 2b2t forever.
* This was the first time that such population numbers were reached on 2b

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2825">{{Rusher}}{{Prediction}}&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt; 

The Second Rusher War, or The Rusher War II, or Rusher War 2.0, is a theoretical event that might have occurred during the summer of 2017, and may occur in the future. 

== Predictions ==
[[Torogadude]] and several others have given their estimates of the percentages of the likelihood of [[TheCampingRusher|Rusher]] returning to 2b over the summer of 2017. Toro estimated a 40% chance, as Rusher gained over 100,000 subscribers over the summer due to his 2b series, reasoning that Rusher would not miss another chance at this goldmine, and his jewfag tendencies could cause him to return.

It is unknown how the 2b2t community or Rusher's fanbase would react. There would probably be a lot of conflict between the waves of Rushers and Veterans, but they likely wouldn't be as severe, due to many Rusher fans becoming bored of 2b last year because of the queue and the fact that they weren't able to easily survive or play on 2b. The veterans would most likely be all over spawn once again in order to prevent further chaos, potentially through another incursion.

Regardless of whether Rusher returns, predictions for the queue length during the summer are that it will be long, as kids will be out of school and have probably remembered the events from the last summer and could attempt to join once more.

FitMC has stated in a livestream that Rusher will not be returning in June of 2017. He stated this after fan questioning and replied with this response and that he is &quot;closest&quot; to Rusher as he has contact with him. However, people continue to theorize, speculate, and question nonetheless, due to Fit being regarded as not being a trustable source by several people in the community, and just for the hell of it.

In a podcast for 2b2t posted on [[Torogadude|Toro's]] channel, Toro, Fit, and several other vets discussed topics of 2b2t, specifically the dawn of June 1st. This of course brought up the Rusher War, and the vets were discussing Rusher's channel. Some vets (mainly Babbaj) wish that Rusher would return to Minecraft, as he has been heavily focusing on Rocket League (Soccer with cars topkek) and Fortnite (PUBG but instead of driving vehicles you build ramps), and that he should return to 2b2t (the possibility of which Babbaj believed to be doubtful).

== Recent News ==
On June 1st, 2017, the community of 2b2t went into a state of remembrance of the war. Rusher has not made a single remark concerning 2b2t on or since the day of the 1st anniversary. As of now, most people have come to the conclusion that the chances of Rusher returning is slim or that he won't come back entirely. As the summer of 2018 encroaches, only time will tell if Rusher will return and until then, 2b2t lies in wait of the result.

The Society is a group of players with a few primary goals. the 1st is to Explain, document, and predict player behavior, both on the large scale (other groups) and the small (individuals). The 2nd goal is to figure out what makes a base more or less likely to be found, and to use that information to create bases that will last a very long time despite being incredibly close to spawn (within 10k). Currently 3 programs are being done by The Society Project in order to further these 2 primary goals (see below).[[File:2017-06-15 20.47.34.png|thumb|287x287px|2 members, at the first Society spawnbase, standing in front of The old Society Symbol.]]

== History ==
The Society (Also known as the Society Project) is a group that was formed from HappySeniorMan's reddit post, &quot;Ideas for bored builders.&quot; The post was about an idea to transform Spawn's lavacasts into a city for newfags to stay and develop. After the idea was well received by the 2b2t subreddit, HappySeniorMan created a group which goal was to create this spawn society.

The first base that was ever made was Melon Hamlet, given that name due to the excessive usage of melons for construction. It might not have been pretty, but for many members of the base it was the first time they had experienced teamwork between players on 2b2t on a large scale. After Melon hamlet, two more spawnbases were created, but none had the same level of activity as the first. After these bases were made, HappySeniorMan became inactive, and The Society did as well.

[[File:SocietyLogo.png|thumb|75x75px|Groups current logo]]
After a long period of inactivity, The Society Project began a revival after Society Governor SonEasterZombie declared that their original spawnbase, the Melon Hamlet, would be rebuilt after its complete grief. Soon other Governors joined him in rebuilding the Hamlet. After the hamlet was griefed for the 2nd time, reconstruction of the base ended. 

Shortly after reconstruction ended, The Society was invited to the [https://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/United_Group_Embassy United Group Embassy]. There members held several leading roles and were focused primarily on the UGE until it eventually became inactive before and during the 6th incursion. It was during this period of inactivity that The Society changed its goal to the one it has now: to research methods of living safely very close to spawn, observe player behavior on a large and small scale, and to collect information on as many 2b2t players as possible, no matter how long they stay on the server. To accomplish this, several programs have been created, each accomplishing a separate goal.

== Experimental Bases ==
Several bases have been created by the society since the end of the 6th incursion for the purpose of testing theories surrounding player behavior and how a bases surrounding area affects its lifespan. The &quot;control&quot; test for these bases was Aeris, a base roughly 40k from overworld spawn that had a portal directly in the center of it, which was done to represent the worst-case scenario. Lasting for 11 days, this represents a good baseline for how effective even basic methods of protection like getting rid of your portal are.

There are currently 3 bases which test various new methods of staying hidden, all of which have lasted far longer than the Control test, despite being even closer to 0,0. While Alkahest_ is the official head-builder among the governors, no one governor runs this program.

== Observation ==
Observation is done by assigning certain Society members to a &quot;Sector&quot;, which is a 1000x1000 section of the world, which they will completely search every 2 weeks(or month depending on the area) to look for nether portal locations, areas of natural terrain that might effect player behavior, and significant builds that may exist in the area. Coordinates to all of these are uploaded on a document for comparison with previous documents from the same sector. This information allows The Society to form new theories about town location or player behavior, and through various methods could even allow for a &quot;heatmap&quot; of spawn and the surrounding areas showing average player traffic in each sector, which would allow for much greater planning of future town locations. This is currently the only program of the 3 that anyone, member or not, can participate in. This program is currently run by governor SonEasterZombie.

== The Library ==
The library is both a build under construction by governor natester1001, and a program with the purpose of both preserving and spreading signed books on 2b2t, as well as collecting information on any player willing to put in the time to tell their story. Players may donate books to any society governor, at which point it will be added to the library itself, as well as being added to a list of books that The Library contains. These books will be copied (If possible) and spread around 2b2t, as well as being available on a per-request basis, as long as you don't mind a wait. If you would like to share your story, donate a book, or ask questions about The Society Project, you can [https://discord.gg/rWuXMqa join our public discord]. This Program is run by governor natester1001

== Relations ==
The Society does not have any allies, as anyone willing to assist in observation or experimental bases would be allowed to as an associate (with a few exceptions). Associate groups are given access to Society information, as well as the private discord, but will not receive full membership roles. As no specific group or faction has ever destroyed a Society Project base or otherwise interfered with a program, The Society has no enemies either, and this will probably stay that way as it is not a PvP faction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4726">[[File:Untitled-0.png|thumb|220x220px|Bridges are a common sight along the canal.]]
The Southern Canal is a monument and public [[highway]] that runs along the +Z axis. The canal stretched for over 150,000 blocks as of July 2018. It has been expanded and maintained by many players throughout its history. The canal carves through hills, mountains and all other natural terrain down to the water surface at y:64.

== History ==
The canal was founded by ThebesAndSound in December 2014 ~26500z with the original intention to build northwards and finish at spawn. Over the span of 4 months Thebes finished the original section between 21.5k and 26.5k.

In March 2015 Thebes contacted ChadDX, who was known at the time for building at spawn. Thebes gave Chad full ownership for how the spawn end of the canal should look and where it should be. Chad decided it should be at 1200, on the outer most ring of the spawn ring roads he had built (400, 800 and 1200). Work was done by ChadDX, joshYarnspinner, Dic and rainyafternoon to complete the 1200 terminal. A short section of canal was made from stone brick leading south away from the terminal. Upon hearing news of the work happening at the spawn end, Thebes travelled to 1200 to meet who was there. This culminated in Thebes's abandonment of the original section to work with the group at spawn and build the canal southwards. This group of players eventually became known as South Canal Corp. 
[[File:2016-12-17 12.32.54.png|thumb|220x220px|The obsidian hand statue, made by Dino_Saurus, which used to mark the old end of the canal at 56k. The statue has since been partially destroyed. ]] 
[[File:Capture3.PNG|thumb|158x158px|Towers along the Canal]]
The canal saw big changes due to the 1.9 Minecraft update. During the update, boats received optimisations that made travelling by boat much easier and smoother and so allowed players to travel at speed on the canal. Also along with 1.9, the enchantment Frost Walker became a problem as players would walk over the water and freeze large sections. Frost Walker damage is no longer an issue as [[Hausemaster]] re-enabled frosted ice melting during [[the Rusher War]], in which the Southern Canal saw significant damage.
[[File:Capture-1.PNG|thumb|220x220px|The South Canal spawn terminal building at 0,1200. This was originally built by ChadDX in March 2015, seen here lastly rebuilt by sudofox before being lavacasted by jared in August 2016]]
[[File:2016-12-14 17.04.57.png|thumb|220x220px|Gigantic lavacast over the canal, marking the 32,000 milestone. ]]
[[File:Capture2.PNG|thumb|220x220px|'Eden' a monument along the canal near spawn]]
During the Rusher War, the Southern Canal was a large hub for [[Rushers]] as they would use it to escape spawn as it was relatively close to spawn and the use of boats reduced hunger. Rushers, along with other griefers, also caused damage to several buildings along the canal. The two terminals at the start and end of the canal's were both griefed during the war.

The top block of the canal walls were fully replaced by Obsidian in July, 2017.

On August 9th, 2017, the Southern Canal reached the 100k. This milestone being announced resulted in the vast majority of the canal to be drained of water using slimestone machines and withered by griefers. A group of volunteers came to the canal and helped South Canal Corp to repair and upgrade the canal, making most of its walls &amp; floor out of obsidian and adding barriers to counter the use of slimestone machinery. There were numerous PvP encounters in the first days of the repair, including an ambush by [[Jared2013]] and [[Spawn Masons|others]] on August 19th, 2017. Later on the griefers lost interest in destroying the canal and the repair team continued on to fully repair and upgrade the canal back to 100k.

== Trivia ==
* According to [[Fit]] , the canal is the longest made canal in Minecraft History. Whether this is true or not is uncertain, however, in a survival perspective, this has a higher chance of being true.
* A silmestone bomber was used to dig the canal from ~33,000 to ~56,000
* The canal has had 2 long term southern most ends, one at 26.5k where it began and another at 56.6k where it meets the Great Southern Ocean that expands to 100k.
* There is a canal that heads northwards from the Southern World border for about 1,000 blocks.
* The canal largely replaced an older road consisting of tunnels and wood plank walkways.
* At 72,000 the canal's water level drops a block, from y: 64 to y:63. This was due to terrain generated in Beta 1.8 and beyond having a lower sea level than that of older terrain. From there on the canal is only two blocks deep.

The '''Communist Party of 2b2t''', commonly known as '''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'The Soviets'''' was formed under the goal of purging [[2b2t]] of fascist imagery. Founded by the three original Politburo members: Valitov, Keat, and Lyanov; a fourth, Virl, would join the Politburo a month later for his commendable actions. The Soviets are notably the largest communist party on 2b2t, and a UGE member state.

==History==
The original concept for The Soviets was started by Valitov in June of 2017. A discord group made for building a gulag to imprison newfags would serve as the meeting ground for Valitov and other communists. Notable members Keat, Lyanov, and Konotsu would meet here for the first time. In June, a new group of harder communists and less cancerous players came together to form a politburo.

The Soviets would come under the official name of the Communist Party of 2b2t, with more members joining to follow the movement. The party received aid from The Companions in the form of better gear and food to assist in their trek out of the spawn area.

The party served the South Canal Corporation in building over 10,000 blocks of canal in exchange for more supplies and goods. While expanding the canal, the first Soviet base was established, named Augustana, later to be renamed the Augustana Commune. The fourth Politburo member, Virl, was added at this time for his contributions towards the commune and party.

However, it would not be long before this base was discovered. With a new base in need, Virl led the Expedition to the Millions to establish a new base: 'The Citadel'. This base would later come under attack from an [[Emperium]] raid. Fortunately, knowledge of the raid was gathered from insiding, allowing a pre-emptive evacuation of all valuable materials and relics.

The Soviets are dedicated to the equality of players, hard work, building, and spreading communism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6277">'''The Three Way Conflict''', was a minor conflict that occured on 2b2t. The conflict started on September 9th, 2016, and supposedly ended with the end of the 5th Incursion. The conflict was primarily between the 4th Reich, Team Aurora, and the Peacekeepers.

== Start of Conflict ==
[[File:Maxresdefault-2.jpg|thumb|220x220px]]
This conflict began towards the end of the Rusher War when Rusher left for the first time. Once many of the Veterans believed that the war was ending, the alliance between the Oldfags and Newfags of Team Veteran began to crack and some infighting began. Once the idea of Team Veteran was put into dormancy by Fit on October 9th, the members began parting ways. Some retired from the server, some went solo, some went to find grander ventures, and some went to building. However, the members of The 4th Reich and Team Aurora began to fight each other. The two groups began exchanging raids, fights, skirmishes and griefs with each other. As the war began to escalate, the last of the Pro-Rusher groups, Peacekeepers joined the fight against the two as both Team Aurora and the 4th Reich conducted raids against them. The Blind Eye Clan (previously known as Ragnarok) attempted to make a peace treaty with the Peacekeepers and Team Aurora to bomb spawn. However, the 4th Reich interrupted this event as they destroyed the Clan's spawn base. The Clan have then decided to stay neutral, therefore the war is a three way war between Peacekeepers, Team Aurora, and The 4th Reich.

== Major Events ==
* 4th Reich vs Neda T- During the events of the Rusher War, the 4th Reich started talking shit around and about Neda T, a Resistance member at the time, when she joined their discord. This caused Neda's hate for the 4th Reich which transended to Post-War events. This event sparked the war.
* Raid on Peacekeeper HQ - The base of the Peacekeepers is griefed by Team Aurora on Spetember 4th, 2016, towards the end of the Rusher War. This caused the Peacekeepers hate for Team Aurora and brought them into the civil war.

* Raid on Neda T's spawn base - On September 7th, 2016, the ex-Aurora member, chairman112, insided the Neda T's spawn base to members of the 4th Reich and Peacekeepers. The members of Team Aurora destroyed their base due to the compromise and 4th Reich and Peacekeeper members soon showed up to fight. This was the first battle between all three groups.
* Battle on Southern Canal- A fight broke out between Team Aurora and the 4th Reich on September 16th, 2016, in which was Fit involved. He became stuck in the crossfire between the two and was constantly on the run.
* Griefing of Aurora HQ- This event occurred when the infamous CancherChan insided Aurora Base. It was griefed by CancerChan and Da99thWolf. This occurred on September 22nd, 2016.
* Party Crashing- This event was when Neda T's Birthday Spawn Base was attacked by the 4th Reich during her birthday stream on October 7th, 2016.
* 3 vs 15+ Spawn Battle- 3 4th Reich members fight 15+ Peacekeeper members in the overworld spawn on October 16th, 2016. This is just about the same amount of combatants as the second largest battle of spawn, technically making two battles in second place.   
* The Triple Treaty - An attempt by The Blind Eye Clan to make a peace treaty with Team Aurora and the Peacekeepers. The treaty failed due to 4th Reich intervention.
* 11/11 dupe - The 11/11 dupe on November 11th, 2016, caused all three groups to gain large amounts of overpowered gear.
* The 5th Incursion - The war came to spawn as all three groups began to fight each other during the 5th Incursion. This event marks the informal war as no group continued the fighting after wards.

== End of Conflict ==
While there is no official date of the conflict ending,  as all three groups haven't been really focusing too much on each other as some of them are beginning to die. The Peacekeepers are currently inactive as PandaSauceYT has taken a break from 2b2t, Team Aurora is inactive as Neda hasn't been doing much, and the 4th Reich moved on. It is safe to assume that this war is over.

Eventually, the 4th Reich disbanded, Team Aurora had become a semi-active group, not getting too involved with 2b2t anymore, and the Peacekeepers were completely inactive. Since then, the Peacekeepers and Aurora seem to have swapped places with Aurora being mostly inactive and PK being semi- active. Aurora and PK have cross pollinated to make Team Rainbow in mid-to-late 2017.

== Major Groups Involved ==
* The 4th Reich
* Team Aurora
* Peacekeepers

== Minor Groups Involved ==
* The Blind Eye Clan (Previously known as Ragnarok)
* Some Team Veteran members not associated with the 4th Reich
* Team V Fawkes (ally of PK)
* Ex-Rusher member TheJadyha
* Some Rusher ex-veteran newfags and wannabes
* Team Rainbow (breeding result of PK and Aurora)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3383">The Tyranny is an infamous group of some of 2b2t's most notorious griefers, PVPers, and nerds. One of their main goals, as stated by [[Fit]] in one of his videos, was to take control of the server from [[Hausemaster]], from the inside out, which they nearly achieved.

== History ==
The Tyranny was founded after the destruction of [[Imperator's Base]], at the commencement of 2016. The group was initially founded by the players [[jared2013]] and taylo112 for the purpose of destroying [[The Lands]]. When the Bed Teleportation exploit of early 2016 was discovered by taylo112 and C4RTM4N, the three of them decided to create a link to The Lands. However, this was impossible without a bed being placed at the [[The Nether|Nether]] coordinates of The Lands. Taylo invited [[iTristan]], who was unable to place the bed as he was no longer at The Lands. Tristan was, however, able to invite someone who was. The Tyranny's fourth member was [[popbob]], who, on his ancient alt RadicalHiccup, was successful in placing the bed and allowing the destruction of The Lands.

After this, [[Sato86]] dubbed this group of players &quot;The Tyranny of 4 Faggots,&quot; a name that stuck and eventually became the official name of the group. The fifth member, [[c1yd3i]], was introduced into the group sometime in April of 2016. At this point, the Backdoor of the Tyranny was functional and The Tyranny had set up a new base at the location of taylo112's 2012 island, as well as a massive, world-edited bedrock sphere known as &quot;The Archive&quot;. This base included many [[Hacked Items|illegal items]] such as [[Super Weapons|superweapons]] and [[Barrier Blocks|barriers]], and several [[Portals|end portals]].

Early in the life of the base, The Tyranny had a week in which they griefed a massive base every single day. This may be known as the [[Week of Destruction]], though it is not formally named. Later, through sheer stupidity, c1yd3i leaked the base to [[Jacktherippa]], which ended the backdoor and conclusively the Golden Age of the Tyranny.

It should be noted that this was not the end of The Tyranny. They later changed their name to nerds inc. officially and still operate as a group. [[Branillon]] was later inducted into the group as the sixth member, and eventually [[fr1kin]] as the seventh and [[IamTUNA]] as the eighth and most recent. Currently the group has eight members and is inactive on 2b2t. Only [[Jared2013]] is active on 2b2t these days. However, they still exist outside of 2b2t, on other servers and parts of the internet in general.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1217">{{NoInfo}}The Unity was a small movement group started by [[Akod]] with the intention of helping newfags out of [[spawn]] by supplying them with all the equipment they required.

== History ==
The movement was started by Akod in early 2014 when he founded the base which he named New Unity. It was less than 5,000 blocks out and was made to show new players that not everyone is hostile and that there could be safety within spawn. Anyone who found their way to it was sent off with an inventory full of items, food, weapons, and armor to help them on their journey out of spawn.

It caught the attention of several large players, who joined and helped build up and maintain the place, which brought even more large players who would stop in from time to time. It was hit by griefers a number of times, but was rebuilt each time to show it would not fall so easily. That was true until mid 2015, when it was destroyed almost beyond recognition by a large player and was finally abandoned by those who stood for it. Rumor has it that [[Anonym00se]] hung around the base for a while after this mass destruction however it is uncertain that he ever rebuilt any of it or not.

The Vikings, also known as the Dutch, were most likely an old raider group on 2b2t. The group is known from an encounter including [[xcc2]] , [[x0XP]], and the [[Brotherhood of the Diamond]]. 

== History ==
Not much is know about the group (other than they might be dutch) due to time, however what is known is that they once had a confrontation with the Brotherhood of the Diamond at one of xcc2's and x0XP's bases. The group threatened to attack xcc2's and x0XP's base and the two asked for help from the Brotherhood. During the defense of the base, they managed to kill two iron armored players, however they turned out not to be the Dutch. The Dutch stated that they had an ally that was grinding gunpowder in order to create TNT and were going to attack the base. After awhile, the group never showed up and so the Brotherhood departed from the base.

The Vo-Perium Conflict, or the Vo-Perium War to members of the groups involved, was a minor conflict on the server that lasted about 3 weeks. The &quot;war&quot; was mainly a conflict between [[The Vortex Coalition]] and the [[Emperium]], hence the name, which is a splicing of both group names. Despite the length of the war, there were several, mainly large, groups involved in the conflict.

== Background ==
Since the Emperium's founding, the group had a negative attitude towards VoCo. The two groups were initially indifferent about each other, however, resent towards each other began when the two started to exchange words and a few member deaths on 2b2t. The bitter relations only got worse in July of 2017, when VoCo forced the disbandment of [[Singularity]] (a VoCo splinter group and Emperium ally). Most of the original Singularity members merged with the Emperium and this only fueled the dislike for VoCo. However, the Emperium did not press hostilities as it focused more on gaining power. As a result of these events, many of Emperium's members are former VoCo members.

About 6 months after the Singularity incident, conflict finally broke out between the two groups when Coltsnid and TheDark_Emperor began to bad mouth each other in 2b2t chat, and VoCo declared the &quot;Vo-Perium War&quot; on December 21st, 2017.

== Major Events ==
* December 21st, 2017 - VoCo declares war on the Emperium after negative words are exchanged between Coltsnid and TheDark_Emperor in 2b2t chat.
* December 27th, 2017 - VoCo posts first meme video of them blowing up an Emperium spawn outpost
* December 30th, 2017 - Unrelated to the Vo-Perium War, VoCo allies with a new, small group known as Inferno.
* January 3rd, 2018 Team Inferno disbands after Emperium insides the group and destroys several of their bases. As a new group, Inferno was a much easier target than VoCo in terms of base security.  
* January 5th, 2018 - VoCo posts another meme video of them blowing up an Emperium outpost for New Years 
* January 7th, 2018 - War officially ends as warring parties soon seek positive relations (except Infrared). 

== End of Conflict ==
[[File:Discord 2018-07-22 23-20-43.png|thumb|433x433px]]
After about 3 weeks of some conflict and mainly inactivity, the groups involved eventually decided to end the conflict on January 11th, 2018, and began to move to more positive relations. This peace agreement was made during a conversation between Coltsnid and TheDark_Emporer, when Emperor proposed the idea of peace and Coltsnid agreed. 

Infrared was the only exception, as they continued to have animosity with the Emperium and now VoCo as well; due to a Joint Communications Discord created between VoCo and Emperium to ease tensions and bring the groups closer together. The two groups now have forgotten the past and have been striding towards an alliance. 

Now, ironically, during VoCo Phase IV, VoCo is working with Emperium to fight Infrared, after Retronautx attacked a VoCo base and made Coltsnid log, starting the VoPerium vs Infrared war.

'''The Vortex Coalition''' (sometimes simply referred to as VoCo) is a large group of players who build, battle, and meme on 2b2t and in its community. Usually during a yearly cycle from around May to January. The group's motto is &quot;an elite group of players dedicated to making 2b2t a better place&quot; (a phrase designed to incite anger in those who dislike the group).

The Vortex Coalition is one of, if not the oldest active group on 2b2t. They own one of the most populated 2b2t related Discord servers with over 600 members (purged of inactive members regularly).

== History ==

=== '''Prologue''' ===

Coltsnid joined 2b2t on August 17th, 2014. During his first few months, he simply explored near spawn, walking around until his hunger bar depleted, dying, and exploring more. In December 2014, AmericanOreo, an IRL friend of Colt's for 7 years, first joined 2b2t. The two decided to walk through the nether to 100,000 blocks out from spawn (overworld) and founded a small base which they would work on every once in awhile. After founding VoCo, they transitioned their aforementioned base into the first VoCo HQ, and invited some friends to the base.

=== '''Phase I''' ===
[[File:Banner.png|thumb|433x433px|VoCo Banner]]

The Vortex Coalition was founded by Coltsnid and AmericanOreo in late May 2015. While the exact date of its founding has been lost to time, the official date for commemoration purposes is June 15, 2015. (YellowstoneJoe has provided Colt and Oreo with chat logs showing VoCo activity on 2b2t as early as May 2015) 

After deciding to begin the formation of The Vortex Coalition, Colt and Oreo began advertising the group using their [http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/VoCo_Bot chat bot], which is where the notorious &quot;[http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/Did_You_Know%3F Did you know?]&quot; bot phrase on 2b2t originates from. This sparked a lot of hate from established players, due to chat spam from newfags without many accomplishments (at the time of the bot implementation). VoCo particularly annoyed Sato86, the VoCo/Sato86 rivalry is one of the oldest on the server and has become a meme to many.

In the group's early days, 2b2t only had an average of about 40 active players. As such, the group had relatively few members (the exception being common newfags joining the group due to advertisements). While VoCo had few members, it still represented a relatively large percentage of the 2b2t player base because of it's easy to join and lenient nature during the late half of 2015.



==='''Phase II'''===

The Vortex Coalition was not as active during the first half of 2016, and consequently suffered a loss of members and relevance. However, they began to increase in activity just before TheCampingRusher joined the server, who subsequently brought hundreds of players onto 2b2t. With the influx of new players ready to make their mark on 2b2t, and the group's policy of accepting anyone regardless of being a newfag/oldfag, The Vortex Coalition was able to recruit far more members than they ever had before.

&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;The Vortex Coalition worked to expand its reach by advertising through memes on /r/2b2t as well as /r/TheVortexCoalition. They also began actively uploading videos to their YouTube channel. This allowed the VoCo community to expand very rapidly. The Vortex Coalition was so prevalent at the height of its popularity that the 2b2t subreddit implemented a new rule forbidding low-quality posts due to VoCo memes that completely covered the subreddit's front page for 4 days.&lt;/span&gt;

Roles in The Vortex Coalition had remained relatively static up until mid-2016. After the large increase of activity, The Vortex Coalition was able to obtain a large number of members, which required a shift in roles to distinguish trustworthy members and new members. In mid-August, the Vortex Coalition added its first new Executive member since Cyan; Ovnel (now known as Joe as of 2017).

==== Bases ====
[[File:Gamma.png|thumb|335x335px]]&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;The Vortex Coalition has built ~365 bases (although the logistics of this number are up for debate, Coltsnid claims this is an estimate), which are spread throughout the 2b2t map in all quadrants. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;VoCo defines a base as &quot;a relatively safe and controlled area outfitted with amenities including beds, ender chests, defensible fortifications, and renewable food sources.&quot; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;Most of these bases are small outposts that serve as &quot;checkpoints&quot; for members to set their bed and possibly farm/autofish. Some, on the other hand, are large, active bases that can have up to 15 members. One of the largest of these bases (member-wise) being Gamma base &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;(pictured right)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;

==== Demeanor ====
[[File:R7VuV9G.png|thumb|231x231px]]The Vortex Coalition has remained relatively peaceful during its existence, not antagonizing other groups, and declaring themselves a noncombatant third party in the [[The Rusher War|Rusher War]]. They are neutral with many groups and have allied with many over the years. They view PVP as &quot;pointless&quot; and the vast majority of their members do not partake in PVP at spawn, due to most VoCo members not being very good at it.      

==== Phase II Lag Machine ====
In September of 2016, Sengorn_Leopard built one of the server's largest lag machines (pictured right). He was later granted an Executive role in VoCo to reward him for his efforts, as well as to solidify the group's control over the lag machine. The coordinates of this lag machine were later leaked by Coltsnid in retaliation of Sengorn_Leopard betraying the Coalition during the disciple/religion meme.      

==== The Wrath of VoCo ====
[[File:Wrath of voco.png|thumb|348x348px]]During 2016, The Vortex Coalition created their own take on the [[Wrath Outpost]] at 420/911 &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;(pictured right)&lt;/span&gt;, which they built overnight. It was unfortunately destroyed within days of its creation during the 5th Incursion. This was the first consecutive summer that The Vortex Coalition had renovated its spawn base. They have continued this trend into 2017 with another renovation at 420/911 (which has already been destroyed). Structures build near spawn are not expected to last long, and VoCo knows this.

==='''End of Phase II'''===
[[File:1c1235 350ab3c1e25e4d50a6dd6b8e7dc907cb-mv2.png|thumb|220x220px|VoCo Meme Flag]]
&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;In January, the Vortex Coalition started getting banned unfairly by the mods in the /r/2b2t Subreddit, they were using rule 4 as an excuse to remove any Vortex Coalition related post. This caused some controversy, however many were glad to see the subreddit cleared of VoCo members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;Coltsnid decided that since VoCo had lost the 2b2t subreddit as a meme platform, he needed to push the memes to the next level. He began to call himself a god, and VoCo members that accepted him as their Lord and savior were accepted into his group of disciples. While many thought this was funny, some were not happy with this change of pace, and this caused controversy within the group. Some members who outright denounced Coltsnid were banned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;Around this time, one of the group's executives, HermeticLock, who was responsible for running the website, decided to change the home page to a meme displaying the Don Fuer logo, which further escalated the tensions within the group, despite it mostly being a joke. On January 13th, 2017, this controversy drove executive member Sengorn_Leopard to the point of banning all users from the discord. When Coltsnid became aware of this, he deleted the discord server and posted [https://redd.it/5nz8za an &quot;official&quot; disbandment] on /r/2b2t. This post gained a lot of attention and once again the focus of /r/2b2t was The Vortex Coalition. &lt;/p&gt;
[[File:VTLoYKxwMwylZ7GfnNYnGIgnuiJY-120pGW6eIE26xU.png|thumb|255x255px]]

&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;Before going inactive for the next several months, Coltsnid had a few more memes up his sleeve, such as &quot;VoCo II&quot; and &quot;selling&quot; the server to &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;&quot;RockyEric&quot; and HermeticLock. VoCo Phase II was to go out with a meme-filled bang.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;With VoCo being one of the largest groups on 2b2t, going inactive caused a significant power vacuum on the server, allowing several other groups to rise and fill the void the meantime. Some of these groups were created by former VoCo members, notably [[Singularity]] and the [[Spawn Masons]].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

=== '''Phase III''' ===

On June 2nd, 2017, The Vortex Coalition ended it's second Off-Season and began recruiting new members. With 2b2t falling into decline, activity in The Vortex Coalition thought it would likely never reach the levels it had during the Rusher Era (however, the group has since grown past the size it was during the Rusher War). Despite the decline in 2b2t popularity, their discord server is one of the most populated 2b2t related servers with over 330 members (Phase III numbers, purged of inactive members regularly).

Salamander, Joe(ovnel), Cyan, and househousehouse1, remained as the executive members.
[[File:420-911-0.png|thumb|526x526px]]
During Phase III, The Vortex Coalition built 11 separate group bases, two of which are major bases sprawling across thousands of blocks. One being a large above-ground city, another being a large underground cave housing a dwarven fortress. They also renovated their 420/911 spawn base for 2017, although it has already been griefed heavily (pictured right).

On September 28th, 2017 The Vortex Coalition expanded onto the me_irlcraft server as a side project/recruitment scheme outside of 2b2t. This expansion proved wildly successful, with The Vortex Coalition receiving over 50 applications from the player base, as well as completely dominating all other forces on the server. Me_irlcraft closed down on November 22nd, 2017.

The Vortex Coalition continues to be the largest and oldest active group on 2b2t, with over [https://imgur.com/MYCfoRu 110 active members] as of January 21st, 2018. Recently VoCo has been heavily investing in spawn operations, such as public infrastructure, spawn bases for new players, and public builds. They are also actively working on a streamlined currency system for VoCo members called VoCoin™.
[[File:SIG.png|thumb|350x350px]]
In mid-December, reports began to circulate that members of The Vortex Coalition had been griefing public infrastructure, such as the [[Southern Canal]]. To push back against this destructive behavior within the group, Coltsnid refined the VoCo [https://www.thevortexcoalition.com/terms Terms &amp; Conditions] to prohibit public builds being targeted by group members.

On December 28th, 2017, The Vortex Coalition announced that it would be taking over executive operations of the Spawn Infrastructure Group (SIG), and provide VoCo resources to further mobilize spawn efforts and efficiently produce reliable roads, bridges, and outposts for all spawn travelers.

=== '''End of Phase III''' ===
On January 30th 2018, Coltsnid announced that Phase III of VoCo was coming to a close. In this statement, it was also announced that all VoCo staff members, including Executives and Trinity members, would be fired, and a new staff will be chosen during the Off-Season and at the beginning of Phase IV. The position of discord Moderator is currently the only staff position, which anyone can apply for.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;This was the most streamlined phase VoCo has ever had, and it yielded great success, not only for our Coalition, but for 2b2t as a whole.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...It has been an honor working with you all throughout the past 7 months to take The Vortex Coalition to new heights, never seen before by any 2b2t group. Our reach is nearly endless when we work together. Our dominance on 2b2t is so unbreakable even I couldn't truly end VoCo, and that means something.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I will see you all in Phase IV!&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

-Coltsnid, Phase III closure announcement.



=== '''2018 Off-Season''' ===
The 2018 VoCo Off-Season will go on record as The Vortex Coalition's most active Off-Season in history (so far). While overall activity within the group decreased as expected, a handful of members and staff remained dedicated to ensuring activity never came to a standstill.

During the 2018 Off-Season, VoCo was a major participant in the 6th Incursion, continued further development of VoCoin™, and kept up consistent recruitment levels. In many ways, the 2018 Off-Season is foundational preparation for the beginning of Phase IV, expected to begin in May or June.

On April 12th, 2018, Coltsnid announced the first Executive members since all staff were fired at the end of Phase III:

joe/ovnel - Executive

HermeticLock - Executive

househousehouse1 - Executive 

iZac - Executive 

Starting in Phase IV, all staff ranks in VoCo are required to be maintained with activity. 

=== '''Phase IV''' ===
On June 15th, 2018, on the 3-year anniversary of VoCo, Coltsnid announced that The Vortex Coalition Phase IV was starting.

After a recent purge, the group is sitting at just over [https://imgur.com/ckPDbQV 150 active members]. VoCo has not had this many members since the height of the Rusher War.

=== Prime Minister Elections ===
On Tuesday, June 19th, The Vortex Coalition held the first Prime Minister election of Phase IV, with 8 candidates running.

HouseCasterly won the popular vote with 44 members choosing him to become the first PM of Phase IV. He went up for re-election after his 2-week term concluded. He chose not to run for re-election.

Casterly had overseen a large-scale VoCo event on 2b2t with several dozen members in attendance. This event while successful was the only event which happened during Casterly's term.

On Tuesday, July 3rd, VoCo held the second PM election of Phase IV, with 6 candidates running.

Ross won the popular vote with 38 votes, with Zoe coming in closely behind at 33.

On Tuesday, July 17th, VoCo held the third PM election of Phase IV, with 3 candidates running.

Ross won the popular vote once again having 33 votes. Zoe came in second again with 20 votes. This election was surrounded by drama and led to fighting between members, though this was later resolved.

=== Notable Events ===
Recently, VoCo acquired the domain [https://joinvo.co joinvo.co], which redirects to the Apply page on their website. According to statistics released by Coltsnid, this has dramatically increased the rate of new users joining the group.

On July 1st, 2018, The Vortex Coalition Discord server reached 600 members for the first time.

On July 3rd, 2018, The Vortex Coalition had 219 registered members. The former record number for any centralized group in 2b2t history.

As of July 17th, 2018, The Vortex Coalition has 242 registered members. This completely smashed it's own record of 219 members - previously the largest number for any centralized group in 2b2t history. The Vortex Coalition continues to gain new members everyday so the number is constantly changing.

== Relations ==
The Vortex Coalition is the largest centralized 2b2t group ever assembled. However, despite this, they rarely ally or war with any 2b2t groups or factions. VoCo is generally pretty friendly towards most groups unless antagonized. VoCo allows members from other 2b2t groups to participate in their ranks without issue.

Currently, The Vortex Coalition is allied with [[Emperium]] in a conflict with the small group Infrared. Outside of the conflict the two groups have good relations and do activities together occasionally.

Many new groups and players rely heavily on The Vortex Coalition's infamous tactics to gaining members, attention, and relevance; such as creating in-game bots, posting countless memes onto the 2b2t subreddit, and setting up a structured group Discord server with an application process and attainable ranks. However, most of these attempts, with few exceptions, fall short of the precise methods used by VoCo for years, and ultimately fail after a short time.

As they say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.

The Vortex Coalition has wiped several small groups off of 2b2t permanently, notably [[Malaria]]. Other group names have been lost to time or were never relevant to begin with.

== Ranks and their meanings ==
IMPORTANT NOTE: Ranks are '''not necessarily examples of active players.''' Some players in the past have worked their way up to VIP or Elite, only to withdraw in activity from the group or 2b2t as a whole. As with the ranking of players, they are mostly ''suggestions'' of how players fit into the hierarchy of the group.

Supreme Leader: Coltsnid - The owner and operator of The Vortex Coalition and it's affiliated projects.

Co-Founder: AmericanOreo - Involved in the foundation of VoCo.

&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;Executive: A rank given to members that are trusted with Discord power and secrets of The Coalition.&lt;/span&gt;

First Class™: This rank is for those that have shown immense leadership capabilities within the group, and is a precursor to the Executive rank.

Developer: Works with VoCo on coding hacked clients, bots, or websites.

Moderator: A newly introduced Off-Season staff role tasked with keeping the Discord civil.

Prime Minister: An elected official from the lower ranked members of the group.

&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;Recruiter: Responsible for recruiting new members to The Vortex Coalition by advertising on /r/2b2t, in chat and through personal contact with players of interest. It is the recruiter's job to go through VoCo applications and grant the Initiate role to new recruits.&lt;/span&gt;

Exalted: The most reputable non-staff rank in VoCo. Exalted members are granted extra permissions in the Discord and are usually involved in most if not all VoCo activities.

Elite: A prestigious rank for those that are fully trusted within VoCo.

Eminent: A respected player with significant sway within the group.

VIP: A trusted player with more privileges in the group. These players typically spent time working on bases with the group and growing the empire as large as it could possibly be.

Member+: A player who has earned the trust of the general population is granted this rank to as a testament to that trust. These players are typically well settled into the group and have begun to take part in activities with other players and bases.

Member: The basic confirmed rank. You have been admitted to The Vortex Coalition if you bear this rank.

Initiate: A one-week trial role given to fresh recruits. Extremely similar to member trust-wise, however, not officially a member of The Coalition.

== Trivia ==
* Did you know? The Vortex Coalition is responsible for the &quot;[[Did You Know?|Did you know?]]&quot; meme due to the group's [[VoCo Bot|bot]]. There are over 150 original VoCoBot DYK messages.
* Did you know? The Vortex Coalition got paid $5 to ban [[SmackAttack86]] from their discord server.[[File:Spawn Squad.png|thumb|297x297px]]
* Did you know? The Vortex Coalition has a spawn squad, featuring many member's alternate accounts, that is ready to log on in mass at any time. With this system in place, VoCo can have an army at spawn within minutes.
* Did you know? The Vortex Coalition spawn base is at x420 y69 z911, and currently features the ruins of an obsidian megastructure built there, known as &quot;The Wrath of VoCo.&quot;
* Did you know? The Vortex Coalition is known for possessing several alt accounts, and because of this, can be just about anywhere on 2b2t at any time.
* Did you know? The Vortex Coalition accepts both new and old players.
* Did you know? The Vortex Coalition official motto is: &quot;The Vortex Coalition is an elite group of players dedicated to making 2b2t a better place&quot;. However, this is a meme, and was specifically designed to trigger those who are not fond of VoCo. One cannot truly change the tides of anarchy.
* Did you know? The Vortex Coalition has created many bases and destroyed others, organised up to 20 members to be online at the same place all at once, they have had up to 30 players logged into 2b2t at the same time, they have utterly destroyed 5 different smaller groups, and they are the reason [[The 4th Reich]] exists.
* Did you know? Each VoCo base is named with a corresponding number since the first VoCo base. For example, VoCo base 297 (AKA Gamma Base) is the 297th base built by VoCo. Other examples include VoCo base 276 (base raided by Tumorous) and VoCo base 329 (AKA Delta Base).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1455">The World Border is a semi transparent wall that surrounds the Minecraft world. The Border is almost 30 million blocks from both sides, and is centered around the center of the world (Spawn, 0, 0). It was made so that players could not venture into glitched chunks. Back in the days, if you went far enough, you would reach the Farlands, glitched terrain that would make mountains that reached the skies, and infinetly long caves. Mobs also acted weird there. And if you went even further, you would fall through the terrain, and shading did not seem to work.

== History of the World Border on 2b2t ==
The history of the World Border is clouded in mystery, as it was reached first sometime in 2011 through a backdoor. This is known thanks to the findings of generated Farlands, and it was defintely reached through a backdoor thanks to that a giant was also found to be spawned in there. This might have been reached through Popbob's, Acid1212's or even Sequal's backdoor access. The modern World Border was first reached by PyroByte and iTristan through their backdoor in December 7th, 2013. There they left some bedrock and two signs.

The first group to reach the sight without a backdoor was the X+ Digging Group, that reahced it in late 2016. At the sight, they built point Nemo, a monument. When players heard of this, they came and griefed the place, and now the border is a very dangerous and griefed place.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="714">The fr1kin Machine Crisis was a crisis on 2b2t that would, according to Fit, be able to crash the server. The server began experiencing enormous amounts of lag during late of March 2017, far worse than the lagdrops during the Rusher War. It is theorized that fr1kin is using a superposition glitch to load massive amounts of chunks, causing the server memory to overflow.

A video by Fit was uploaded entitled &quot;THE END OF 2B2T?&quot; where he explains the fr1kin crisis. This caused the Subreddit to be flooded with [[2b2t Doomsday|doomsday clock]] [[shitposts]]. Eventually, what was known as [[the Apocalypse Exploit]] was patched o April 9th, 2017, causing the Crisis to end.

== Recent Activity ==
Tim is the most active user on the 4th Reich's YouTube channel, posting videos of him griefing, meming, and other stuff. Tim has also claimed that he is [[Jared2013]], but this is up for debate among the community. Tim also runs the United Fags of 2b2t and 4th Reich Discord. While Tim still plays, he seems to not be uploading his fun of griefing anymore.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="708">&quot;Time to smoke x and eat/drink y&quot;, Most of the time known as &quot;Time to smoke weed and eat pizza&quot;, is a meme that is mostly associated with the player who popularized it, grindlord. It is probably a reference to the famous line from They Live, &quot;I have come to chew bubblegum and kick ass&quot;. Variations of the phrase are uttered (spammed) in the server chat by other players, but none of them ever stick to it long enough like [[grindlord]] or yugiohsecret (some irrelevant midfag) do with those lines. This meme, just as &quot;[[A Friendly Christian Server|christian server]] &quot; has leaked into the wider internet and has become a discredited meme to some people.

The history of 2b2t is one of the most diverse, most interesting, and most all-encompassing histories ever to take place within the world of a digital game. Wars have come and gone, cities have been built and been destroyed, empires have risen and fallen, and vast tracts of the world have been significantly changed, through the years, and all of it has been entirely through the actions of players. It has been written by hundreds of thousands of players, and has spanned over seven years, and continues to be written day by day.
[[File:Timeline 2016 (4).png|thumb|490x490px|centre]]NOTE: The Sato timeline is outdated 

== The 4chan Period ==
''For more details, go to [[The 4Chan Period]]''

'''Player Count: 50-70'''

Nothing is much known about the early days of 2b2t, except that the server began on December of 2010. This was the earliest point of 2b2t, and only a few of the players from the 4chan Period stayed until the recent eras. These players are often called Ancientfags.

== The Forum Massacre Period/Facepunch Republic Era ==
''For more details, go to [[Forum Massacre Period]] and the [[The Facepunch War|Facepunch War]]''

'''Player Count: 50-70'''

In April 2011, users of Facepunch found out about 2b2t, and decided to take control of the server. They built lots of monuments, however 2k2k is the most famous out of all of them. This republic eventually ends a year later, in February 2012 (however some ripples of Facepunch continued into 2013).

== The First Valkyrian Period/Age of Popbob ==
''For more details, go to [[First Valkyrian Period]]''

'''Player Count: 10-30'''

This symbolizes the formation of Valkyria. They are led by famous and well-known players of 2b2t. This is also the era where [[Popbob]] is extremely prominent with his thunder hacks.
* April 2013 - Valkyria is founded
* May 2013 - 1.4.7 Dupe, The End Dragon is slain
* (Unknown month) 2013, Construction of [[HardHat's Pyramid]] has started.

* August - October 2013 - 2nd Incursion
* October/November 2013 - Shenandoah is founded
* December 2013 - 2b2t gets backdoored, Pyrobyte has reached the World Border.

== Legion-Gape Interlude Period ==
''For more details, go to [[Legion-Gape Interlude]]''

'''Player Count: 30-20'''

This period is sparked by the abandonment of Asgard, and a small decrease in player size.
* January 2014 - Asgard is abandoned
* May 2014 - 2k2k is buried in lavacasts.
* June 2014 - Legion of Shenandoah begins, Gape 1 is founded, Fenrir is founded.

''For more details, go to [[The Rusher War]] and [[Age of Hype]]''

The summer of 2016 gives 2b2t its unwanted fame, in the form of TheCampingRusher, a YouTuber with 1 million subscribers (roughly 800k on June 1st, 2016), leads his fanbase to 2b2t, causing player rates to overflow, and numerous monuments to fall. It is the most documented period in 2b2t, and is a period that will change the server's history and future, forever.

A lot of groups spawned from this war, most notably Team Rusher, Team Veteran, The 4th Reich, the Peacekeepers, the Resistance, and Team Aurora.

Notable events: The 4th Incursion, The Rusher War, The 11/11 Dupe, and the French Crisis

== Grand Deceleration Period/Grand Retard Period/Post-Hype Period ==
'''Player Count: 80-200 (50-100 during Temp Maps)'''

''For more details, go to [[Grand Retard Period]]''

Shortly after the end of the Rusher War, the server goes on a slow decay. Most players gave up on 2b2t after the Rusher War, such as most Rushers giving up in the queue, and oldfags getting bored of the server. However, the queue still exists at a lesser extent. The amount of factions in 2b2t also decreased but some present day groups were founded during this time. This was not as severe of a decay as the previous decays the server has faced, where upwards of 80% of players stopped playing, but rather a decay to a stable population consisting of a regular player population who kept playing after the Rusher War.

Notable Events: 7/21 dupe, Third Largest Battle of 2b2t History, Apocalypse Exploit, Donkey Dupe, Spanish/Taco Crisis.
* January 2017
** The Vortex Coalition gets &quot;disbanded&quot;.
** Fit returns to 2b2t, with new jewtuber, kid friendly content. The impact from this has kept the 2b2t playerbase in its 200s, as many players join from Fit each day.
** [[Spawn Masons]] are founded
** [[Pacific Heights]], a small group base is griefed by 0xymoron and Slappnbadkids.
* February 2017
** [[The 4th Reich]] is disbanded.
** HermeticLock's Spawn Base is constructed and The Third Largest Battle of 2b2t History occurs there. The base was constantly rebuilt and lavacasted over and over
** 15 milliontown is built by the nether highway group*
** Highland is founded by The_Grand_Lotus
** Toro's Theater begins construction
** 2b2t logo rebranded
** Kinorana [[Kinorana Map Crisis|hacks all maps]] in 2b2t. Protests against Kinorana begin.

This is the first confirmed time slave labor is used in the server's history to complete a community project.
** April 26th, 2018 - The obsidian wall ends up being a failure due to the fact that players are dedicated enough to spend 7 minutes breaking 2 obsidian blocks.

== The Age of Rebirth ==
''For more details, go to [[The Age of Rebirth]]''

''Note: this period is ongoing and may be subject to name changes. Add new events here.''

This period began towards the end of [[jared2013|jared2013's]] &quot;31days31greifs&quot; event. Nearly every major base on the server had been hunted down and destroyed, creating what jared called a period of “Rebirth” from the ashes of these former bases and player relationships.

Notable Events: TheDaarickPartner Series, BGM Greif, Beardler/Museum Drama, Resurfacing of 32ks
* June 2018
** June 1st, 2018 - 31days31griefs officially ends, Jared posts about this on the subreddit on June 1 that the griefing will stop on his part. He calls this new period the “Rebirth” of 2b2t as most major group bases are now gone.

He later posted that he would be taking a long break from 2b2t and said he regretted his actions.

Hey people of the wiki, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xgk7cfCTckg, check this video which uses information from the site. Pretty cool but if you scroll to the comments, you'll see a lot of oldfag rage (topkek) concerning the older days of 2b2t. I'm doing a large sweep of older history to fix inaccuracies (due to Sato's bs topkek again) and stuff like that :DDDD. Anyone can help

== Progress Information ==

=== ASS GUARDZ UNO (DESPACITO II WAS THERE SHHH) ===
* Asgard I was a project anticipated by the [http://2b2t-anarchy-server.wikia.com/wiki/Valkyria Valkyrians] after the [[Incursion|2nd Incursion]] . It was supposed to occur at the same time as the biome update, but due to interference w/ [[Popbob]], the project was a failure. (WIP)

[https://imgur.com/gallery/rahd1 Source of information here...]

=== Kinorana ===
* Kinorana, who was previously known as the Blacksmith of 2b2t during the Valkyrian Era as mentioned by [[Fit|FitMC]], is an oldfag who is most known for the [[Kinorana Map Crisis]] and his ability to make [[Hacked Items|stacked armor]] (the exploit has since been patched).

In May of 2017, kinorana had access to the SSH of 2b2t from the [[April Fools Map 2017|April 1 map]]. He used this to recreate the legendary [[Super Weapons|32k weapons]]. He also sold the exploit for $3500. It is unclear of what else he may have made, but because he had it for well over a month it can safely be assumed he did some damage to the server itself. It is rumored that he made his base out of [[bedrock]] and added numerous [[Portals|end portals]] for his own use as well as for his friends, such as Nukkuh.

He is known for his catchphrase, &quot;Buy Kinorana goods today!&quot;, which has always been spammed in chat by himself and others who wish to promote his services.

=== Subreddit Page ===
*  The [https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t/ 2b2t Subreddit] is a subreddit on [https://www.reddit.com reddit] (duh) where people who play on 2b2t (or at least know of it's existence) can submit 2b2t related content. Memes, Shitposting, and ''Drama ''relating to 2b2t are here. The 2builders2tools admin is speculated to be owned by [[Curtis]].



According to the [[queue]], the subreddit itself is one of the three official contacts of 2b2t (all owned by Hause (with the reddit being te only discrepancy)). The other two being 2b2t.org (which has been down for atleast 4 years) and 2b2t.org@gmail.com which is the server's email (where you can freely spam and shitpost Hause :DDD).

[[File:Capture-1495151322.PNG|thumb|220x220px]]The 2b2t subreddit admins are known to delete any post criticising or questioning [[Fit]] as well as banning users for posting them. This raises questions about admin abuse on the subreddit as well as confirming the theory that Fit is being used to bring more money to the server owners.

=== YellowStoneJoe (NOTE: Questionable crap, a few facts are true) ===
* YellowstoneJoe joined 2b2t in January 2014. Group bases he has participated in include King's Landing, Aureus, and Kinograd Base (KGB).

YellowstoneJoe designed and built much of the 'nether ring road' 1 kilometer out from spawn. He is also known for being one of the largest enemies of &lt;nowiki&gt;[[The Vortex Coalition]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; . In 2018, his ways has changed after the leak + greif of the base Block Game Mecca, and blamed Beardler, admin of several 2b2t communities and positive role model of the 2b2t community for the leak despite having no real evidence whatsoever. He also should not be trusted when it comes around bases, and other might put the blame on you. YellowStoneJoes activity is moderate, as hes on from time to time.

=== Jerico City ===
WIP Jerico City was a city created by Bigdon. It was toured by[[ Fit]] in a video in late 2016. It is/was a fairly large and detailed walled city built mainly out of sandstone, cobblestone, and acacia wood, located on a desert peninsula, and originally built around a generated NPC village. It is/was home to a large population of villagers as well as a few iron golems, and a collection of gold blocks salvaged from [[Aureus City|Aureus]] before its destruction.


=== Corrupted Uncornz ===
'''CorruptedUnicorn''' was the leader of the Resistance. &lt;span class=&quot;&quot;&gt;He rose to infamy after griefing the historic monument &quot;&lt;/span&gt;The Valley of Wheat&quot;. Since then, he has been a greater threat to [[Team Veteran]] then [[TheCampingRusher]] himself. Corrupted and the Resistance prefer to patrol spawn in great numbers, forcing players to either run away, log, or accept death.

CorruptedUnicorn first joined 2b2t on June 22nd, 2016.  He made his first video on 2b2t about a floating island base. He continued to make videos until he began making friends on the server.

=== 2 porkie boi 2 beep boop ===
2pork2bot is a spam bot that was created by [[DaPorkchop_]]. Originally it served to praise [[Team Pepsi]] and quote [[memes]] that could be given to Pork over Discord.

Now it's the Minecraft side of a 2b2t web overview, with chat viewing, tab+player list viewing and DM sending/recieving. The site can be accessed via http://www.daporkchop.net/pork2b2tbot

=== Museums ===
Museums are bases made by players with the intention of keeping some of 2b2t's artifacts such as various &lt;nowiki&gt;[[map art]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;s , rare blocks, armor of notable players, and some of the oldest items on 2b2t. WIP

{{Space Valkyria|built = February 2017|builder(s) = [[The Nether Highway Group]]|coordinates = X: 15,000,000 &lt;br&gt;
Z: 0}}The 15 Million Town is a base that was built by the Nether Highway Digging group. It was a milestone for completing half of the Nether Highway. Construction began on February 2017 and is a free place for anyone to build on or destroy. (Most likely lavacasted by now)

== Features ==
* Popbob Head
* The Hall of Maps
* The 15 Million Temple
* HermeticLock's SpawnMason lodge
* Househousehouse1's gape
* Megasteel32's Tower to the Heavens

=== Grand Lotus (OBVIOUSLY questionable, bias, and needs a rework) ===
'''The Grand Lotus''' is the leader of the [[Highland]], and is infamous for spamming about the group in chat. Easily gets angry. Supports giving free stuff to newspawns, as well as communism. Comparatively somewhat of a decent person, except when annoyed. Attempts to brainwash people and use them for experiments. He quit 2b2t as confirmed on the subreddit, because of the fact his girlfriend made him.

=== JackTheRippa ===
Jacktherippa is a longtime player who has participated at many bases such as [[Asgard II]], [[Aureus City|Aureus]], and several others, and is famous for being the builder of [[Space Valkyria]].

== History ==
Toro's Theater was intended as a filler on Toro's channel because Torogadude accidently died in the End when his character looked at an enderman while being afk.  

After about two months, toro showed off the complete build, but during his livestream he accidently leaked the coords while toro was doing a world download for the theater. As you can probably guess, people were there to blow the base up in no time and the whole base was destroyed. Toro jumped in on the griefing. 

== Architecture ==
The base was completely underground and, as the name implies, was a large theater (before it was turned into a crater that didn't do the job well). The base, was completely made out of wooden planks and other wooden material (specifically birch and acacia) it was also built with clay blocks and stone bricks.[[Category:Places]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3833">Torogadude, nicknamed &quot;Toro&quot;, is a notable midfag on 2b2t who is most known for the #FreeToro crisis during [[the Rusher War]] and for his YouTube channel that has several informative videos on 2b2t. He no longer makes videos of 2b2t on his channel but still had a great impact on the server.  {{2B2T Player Template|approx_join_date = November 2015|status = Inactive|known_alternates = edudagorot, little_toro|current_affiliation(s) = |past_affiliation(s) = [[Team Veteran]] [[The 4th Reich]] [[Team Pepsi]] [[Spawn Masons]]|image1 = Untitled-3.png|caption1 = Toro's Skin|reddit_username = torogadude}}

== History ==
Torogadude first joined 2b on November 23rd, 2015. He started out on 2b like any other player did on 2b by collecting resources and creating small bases. He started to be known a lot more as he began to interact with other older players, such as [[Fit]].

[[File:CvlEWcP.jpg|thumb|200x200px|Toro in real life]]

=== Rusher War ===
During the war, Toro got himself involved with [[the 4th Reich]] and [[Team Veteran]]. He would do what all other Vets did, which was kill and destroy Rusher's and their bases.

Torogadude began to gain recognition on the server when he started to expose [[TheCampingRusher]] for the jew he was after his [[Queue|veteran queue]] was revoked after he triggered one of the Queue admins. This caused a large backlash against Rusher under the name #FreeToro. His priority queue was later restored after Rusher caved in to the pressure from the community.

=== Post-War ===
After the war, Torogadude began to focus more on his channel. Eventually, he started several live streams related to 2b2t and built a base in the End called the [[Death Star II]]. However, he died during the construction when he accidentally left his player in AFK mode and it looked at an enderman, which later killed him. Since then Toro has returned to the [[Death Star II]] and continued construction.

In the time between toro dying at the [[Death Star II]] and returning to it, Toro started a new project called [[Toro's Theater]], an underground European-style theater build, in the mean time. He also joined [[Team Pepsi]] at this time when [[the 4th Reich]] disbanded and has been a member since. He joined due to influence from other Pepsi members in his discord. Recently, Toro has predicted that TheCampingRusher had a 40% of returning to the server in the summer of 2017. However, several oldfags, such as Fit, has stated that he won't come back at all. It has been confirmed that Rusher did not return on June 1st, 2017. 

=== End of 2b2t content ===
In March of 2018 Torogadude announced that he no longer would be making 2b2t Minecraft content on his channel. This was long expected, as he had been suggesting his 2b2t viewers go and watch his other, more interesting, non-2b2t content. He still says he would keep in touch with the people of the server and has been seen on the subreddit since. 

== Past Role on the Server ==
Torogadude ran a youtube channel by the same name. He was a commentator on 2b2t's events, explaining the various dupes, exploits, and other things related to 2b. He was well known for streaming his (now greifed) [[Death Star II]] in the End and also used to do several other livestream series on 2b2t, such as the 2b2t Podcast, A walk on 2b2t, The Hunt, etc.. He had about 11.5k subscribers on his channel at its peak but has slowly been declining in views and subscribers since he quit making 2b2t videos on his channel, therefore he has little relevance on the server any longer.

Trade is a very common form of interaction between players on 2b2t and has been since even the early years of the server's history. It is one of the essential pieces of its [[2b2t Economy|economy]]. Trades can involve anything from ingame items, to hacked clients, to accounts. Trades can either be exchanged for other ingame items or for actual currency IRL. 
==​Types of Trade and Merchants==
Map Merchants - Merchants who sell [[map art]].

Rare/Hacked Item Merchants - Merchants who sell [[Hacked Items|hacked items]] (virtually non-existent now as Hausemaster has removed most, if not all hacked items.

Account Merchants - Merchants who sell alt accounts that either have plenty of gear (a storage alt) or (previously) ones that had [[queue|Veteran Queue]].

Custom Client Merchants - Merchants who sell custom made [[Hacked Clients|hacked clients]] with promise of better performance on 2b2t (could be backdoor'd). Some clients are also sold which promise [[Duplication Glitches|duping]] abilities.

Gear Merchants - Merchants who sell standard gear like god gear, gapples, etc.

World Download Traders - Merchants who trade [[World Download]]s of 2b2t builds.

==​Independent Merchants==
Independent merchants are players who simply trade with others for self gain and not to benefit a specific group. They usually trade on their own but can acquire aid and advertisement from a Trade Company or even join the company entirely. These merchants do not necessarily affiliate with normal [[factions|groups]] (however, most do). They could also work with a small amount of others (like friends or fellow groupmates).

Known Merchants (feel free to add more):

[[Kinorana]] - Well known Gear/Hacked Item Merchant who is notably known for selling stacked armor.

[[uglykids]] - A spawn map merchant.

Andrew_Gil - An old merchant who traded with [[The Fellowship of the Diamond|the Fellowship of the Diamond.]]

[[Breadl]] - New Essential/Stacked/Hacked Items Merchant 

Many More
== Trade Companies/Networks==
[[File:Voco trade network.png|thumb|220x220px|VoCo Trade Network]]
Some players have organized trade networks in order for easier and more trustworthy trade. They can either advertise independent merchants or offer their own trades and prices. These networks usually involve real life currency but can also simply involve ingame only.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5052">Travelling is a very important part of every 2b2t player's life. It is what pretty much every player does at some point or another. Players have made great travels throughout their time on the server whether it be just to simply explore or to build as far as possible from spawn. People have already reached all the way out to the world border while back in 2011, even 100k away from spawn was already considered far.

== Methods of Travel ==
There are several methods of travel used by players on 2b2t. Some of them being exploits and other being natural minecraft methods.

=== Highways and Speed Hacks ===
The main way of travel is to use speed hacks on the main [[highways]] (obsidian paths that extend from spawn all the way out to the edges of the map). Many players tend to use the Nether highways rather than the overworld ones as travelling one block in the Nether equivalates to travelling 8 blocks in the overworld, which cuts the travel times.

=== Animals ===
Players on 2b2t also use animals in order to get around the server. In fact, some players prefer the use of horses to the standard speed hacks as horses do not get glitched out due to anti cheat and can easily traverse block tall ledges. Some horses are even faster than basic speed hacks on flat surfaces. Many players have bred horses to be the fastest that they can possibly be in vanilla Minecraft. People have recently started using pigs due to an exploit using the Future Client. The exploit is known as entity speed, which speeds up any vehicle or animal. While the exploit can be used on horses and llamas, players prefer the pig due to it being able to fit through one block small holes and can successfully get a player through above blocks without crashing. Using a pig with speed hacks could take a player to the world border in 33 hours, taken that they use the[[+X Axis Highway| +x highway]].

=== Boats ===
Boats are a fairly used means of travel, especially when escaping spawn for the first time, as you can travel tens or even hundreds of thousands of blocks thanks to 2b2t's enormous oceans and[[ the Southern Canal]]. Boats are currently being used heavily by players as an exploit with the Future client allows for boat flying. Many of the main glitches and exploits have been patched but several are continuously being found.

=== Flight ===
Flight is another fairly used means of travel by players. Despite fly hacks being patched due to game breaking rules, players have found other methods to fly around the server. These include using airships and the recently added elytra during the 1.9 Minecraft update. People were actually able to use elytras to infinitely fly around the server until [[Hause]] disabled elytras for a short period until he patched this infinite flying. In 1.11.2, the elytra is now able to be flown long distances with the usage of fireworks which boost players through the sky and people have already found other ways to infinitely fly around with elytras (despite the original method being patched).

Airships have been used as well to fly around. Usually, airships are used in the end due to the vast chasms of void which cause difficult travel, but players have flown in the overworld as well. The most known pilot of airships is [[Fit]] , who broke the server's flight record. James Rustles has given him the title of the &quot;pilot of 2b2t&quot;. BastiVC is also known to have been a pilot of airships as he invented his signature bomber. Fit has also said Basti is a better pilot than himself.

=== Bed Travel ===
The most notorious travel exploit was the Bed Godmode exploit, which allowed players to leave their beds (while in bed) and go through Nether portals to teleport to the nearest bed (which could be millions of blocks out). This exploit, however, has been patched.

Another version of this exploit was found by [[househousehouse1]] by setting up a nether portal next to the bed. Wait until night time. Then go in the portal. Before teleporting to the Nether, the player sleep in the bed and they will automatically jump out of the bed in the Nether at the coordinates of the bed in the Overworld. This was also patched before it was released to the public.

=== AFK Travel ===
When [[highways]] get clear (usually when the player is out of the range of spawn) players eventually get tired of physically staying on their computer using speed hacks. Luckily for players, there is a common hack on most clients known as Auto-Walk which obviously automatically makes your character walk without the use of your keyboard. People then have the choice to go AFK and let their character walk for hours on hours on end on the highway to get to their desired destination. '''However, '''a risk associated with AFK-walking is the fact that many highways are not in 100% build condition, and as such there could be holes and gaps which require manual traversing. Left on auto-walk, an AFK player can walk himself into his own demise if he is not careful.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1440">8000 Base, colloquially called Tugboat Base, is a base which was built by a group called [[The Fellowship of the Diamond]] sometime in 2015. It was amongst the last bases of the Fellowship before they all quit after their resurgence in 2015.
[[File:2017-08-22 19.31.56.png|thumb|220x220px]]
[[File:2017-08-22 19.32.07.png|thumb|220x220px]]
[[File:2017-08-22 19.32.43.png|thumb|220x220px]]

== History of the Base ==
The base was built relatively near spawn, like many of Fellowship's bases in mid 2012. It consisted of a large cobblestone castle, a stone brick tower, and a cartoony tugboat in a harbor outside the castle. The Base had &quot;charm&quot; despite its questionable architecture. The tugboat is how the base got its common name due to not many people knowing it's original name name.

In 2013, most members of the Fellowship became bored, or had other things in life, so they quit 2b2t. Tugboat Base became abandoned, and was forgotten until late 2013, where it was griefed heavily, and was forgotten again. In 2014, individual players came across the decimated Tugboat Base and across many months, different players rebuilt Tugboat Base. When the Fellowship eventually resurfaced in 2015, it returned to its former glory, and the signature Tugboat was built. By [[the Rusher War]] , Tugboat Base was intact, and even in good enough shape for [[FitMC]] to tour it (unless he used a world download).

Tytoowns281 is a [[4channers|4channer]] most notable for being a Kill on Sight for the [[Facepunch Republic]] and teaming/basing with the infamous [[Luke2thebun]]. His most famous grief was the grief on [[Passie Town]], majorly led by Luke2thebun. Tytoowns281's minecraft account was hacked sometime in 2015, and it was then given out for free.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1367">uglykids is a user on 2b2t. He joined 2b2t in around January of 2014 with the username 'KEEKO64'. He has been apart of several groups and bases, e.g. [[The Peacekeepers]]. He wasn't proud of being a part of them, and he eventually left after only being a member of their group for a couple of hours (kek).

He was a known trusted trader at the [[The Nether|nether]] spawn (0,0) and regularly traded [[Map Art|map art]].

He fell in love with map art as soon as he got his first map. Sadly, due to [[kinorana]] [[Kinorana Map Crisis|resetting all maps]], he eventually burnt his collection and he really had nothing to do at [[spawn]] anymore.

He then left spawn for a very, very long time and moved to [[the world border]] hoping that one day map art will be entirely fixed and he can finally return to spawn, his home...

During the summer of 2017 he joined the dig to the + x and z corner. After around a week or two he found him self very isolated and bored. He was able to contribute 120 thousand blocks to the tunnel before killing back to spawn.

As of the 15th of October 2017, uglykids has officially quit 2b2t. After being a player for over three years uglykids finally quit 2b2t due to the owner ([[Hausemaster|Hause]]) being a sellout scumbag who would prefer to loose most of the older players for a bit more cash.[[Category:People]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6057">'''Welcome To 2b2t.org. The worlds worst (and 4th oldest) minecraft server. '''You are reading this page for one reason: to escape spawn, work hard, and be successful. This information is 100% accurate for June, 2018.

== How to Escape Spawn ==
[[Spawn]] is a desolate wasteland filled with blown-up [[Lavacast]]s, geared spawnfags, and pits that bring you to the bottom bedrock layer of spawn. The Escape Spawn guide tells you everything on how to escape spawn.

'''Before you join, get a [[Hacked Clients|Hacked Client]]. Presumably Wurst, as Wurst has wonderful cosmetics such as Inventory See, Nearby Players, and Tracers that tell you how far a player is from you. Download Wurst here: '''

☀https://www.wurstclient.net/download/
# When you join, '''do /kill until you get to a coordinate close to a [[Highway]] '''(ex: X 1000, Z 0). The closer you are to a highway, the higher chance of survival.
# '''Dont go to 0 0 and ask for help.''' Players known as spawnfags will trap you in a nether portal trap, making it impossible to escape until a spawnfag kills you or you break the trap (which takes a long amount of time). Spawnfags also try to ruin your experience by using crystals to blow you up. Be wary if you constantly see people getting killed in chat, as these are probably spawnfags killing new players. If one of these spawnfags claim they will help you, '''ignore them by doing /ignore (username). '''If you come across one of these spawnfags (if you are using Wurst, a green line will become red if a player is near you), '''press Alt and F4 at the same time. '''This closes out your game faster than disconnecting. However, if you have no items and no priority queue status, it is less time consuming to get killed. Rarely, geared players will come to you and ask you questions. Be sure to be honest as these player might give you free items, making it a cakewalk to escape spawn. '''Do not rely on this method however, as hardly anyone at spawn will be friendly to newer players. '''If you have trusted friends who you have known before finding out about 2b2t, you can ask them for help if they play on 2b2t.
# '''Never enter a portal under 5000 overworld blocks. '''Once again, spawnfags love ruining your experience and will trap nearby portals. The farther you walk from spawn in the overworld, the safer you are.
# '''Harvest trees for apples.''' After 10,000 overworld blocks, trees will start becoming abundant, and less spawnfags will be on the highway. Create an axe and harvest apples from trees as a food source.
# '''Do NOT go to the [[Valley of Wheat]] if you are traveling the X+. '''The Valley of Wheat has been griefed several times, and spawnfags will tend to wait for new players such as yourself to harvest the remains of the VoW. Some players have attempted to restore it, but it is usually an unsafe place and hard to navigate through.
# After 20,000 blocks of travel, you can begin gathering resources (although do not expect any bases under 100 thousand blocks away from spawn, and are well off whatever axis you used to travel). '''Find the nearest nether portal and start traveling as long as you want. '''If you find a saddle, you can use a horse or a pig for faster overworld travel (assuming you have EntitySpeed hacks for the pig).

== How to Gather Resources and become Rich ==
'''This guide is for players that have all ready escaped spawn. This guide will not be in use if you have not escaped spawn.'''

After awhile of walking in the nether, its time to create a temp base for yourself. A tempbase is good for new players that need to collect resources and other materials.
# Build your tempbase around 100,000 to 200,000 blocks away from spawn, and 5000 to 10000 blocks away from the [[Highway]]. Make sure to be in 1.7+ chunks or above (ex: biomes aren't messed up).
# '''Make a bed. '''This is so you will respawn at your base, and not at spawn when you die.
# '''Make a fishing rod and turn on AutoFish. '''Autofishing is the most popular method of gaining EXP and food. In Wurst, click the right SHIFT key, and type in Autofish in the GUI. (NOTE: Autofishing might disconnect you from the server, and remember to put Mending on your fishing rod so you can repair it. Also, don't wear any armor or hold any tools that have Mending).
# '''Create Protection 4 Armor and decent tools. '''This will make it harder for griefers/pvpers to kill you if you are on a highway.
# '''Create an eChest. '''Put things like food, tools, and wood into your eChest. If you have shulkers, you can carry more items at once.
# From time to time, a [[Duplication Glitches|Duplication Glitch]] is found on 2b2t, and is used to duplicate items. '''Find out how to preform the duplication method to duplicate your current items. '''(NOTE: '''NEVER INSTALL CLIENTS THAT ARE MADE FOR ITEM DUPLICATION ON 2B2T. '''These clients are made to collect your location, and is shared across platforms such as reddit and discord). If you aren't rich, but have rich friends, you can ask them to help you get rich.
# If you have a lot of money on you, '''spend money on kits and tools. '''Vendors tend to supply things such as shulkers of totems, golden apples, and much more. '''WARNING: '''If a seller does not use paypal, do not buy from the seller, as other platforms do not allow you to refund/chargeback the seller if you didn't receive what you get.
After awhile, you will collect enough resources to leave your tempbase and travel farther on 2b2t.

== Facts and Questions ==
Q. What is the IP to 2b2t?

A. '''2b2t.org'''

Q. I got invited to a group called Voco/Armorsmith etc; should I join?

A. '''No. These groups will enslave you at 0 0, and will crystal you once you are done with their work.'''

Q. How do I get invited to a base?

A. '''By gaining reputation on the server. DO NOT ASK PLAYERS ON REDDIT IF YOU CAN BASE WITH THEM. This will lower your reputation.'''

Q. Should I create a group?

A. '''No'''

Q. Should I create a group base?

A. '''Not yet, unless you have trusted friends to help.'''

[[File:Unidad.png|thumb|140x140px|Unidad Logo.]]
[[File:Unidad Banner.png|thumb|270x270px|Unidad Phase II Old Banner.]]

==== Creation of Unidad ====
After spamming the invitation to Unidad to the players who were in Akex, almost everyone who was in Akex joined Unidad. The Unidad leaders banned GamerAddict and started an operation against him. The group was pacifist with other factions.

==== Paragon (from Unidad Phase II point of view) ====
Paragon was created by AlienAgent124, SCULLY and Sage_Matthias. The base's location was secret, but as it was not very far from spawn, it was only a matter of time before it was accidentally discovered. Eventually, YotoGamer found it by chance. He was in the Akex Army created by AkexAddict, and sent him the coords of Paragon. Then, Akex joined Inferno (the old Infrared) and he gave them the coords to Paragon. By this time they had allied with VoCo, and Emperium were enemies with VoCo. They had an insider in Inferno, and once they found the coords of paragon, they  griefed the base and killed Inferno. Since then, Infrared have allied with Unidad.

==== Relation with Infrared ====
Many people in Inferno were in Unidad. Retronaut(the leader of Infrared) made an offer with YotoGamer. That offer was to ally Infrared with Unidad. YotoGamer accepted because they were also involved in the griefing of Paragon and they could help with an operation. Infrared was kicked from the embassy. They started a war againist Emperium and they griefed the embassy. They broke relations with Infrared.

==== The split ====
YotoGamer told the leaders and the members of Unidad to keep the server alive because he will be inactive for 3 months. When he came back, he discovered that they created a new server with the same name and changed the name of his server to Unidad archival version. He joined their server and he gave ownership to PepperX but then after he was denied moderator status he changed his mind. An Argument ensued between the two leaders resulting in a split in the membership. After a while, they decided to become 2 seperate groups Exodus &amp; Unidad (2). Exodus would use the server owned by PepperX and Unidad (2) would use the original server owned by YotoGamer.

==== Relations ====
* Team Infrared - Past-allies
* VoCo - Friendly
* SIG - Friendly
* Highland - Neutral
* Emperium - Neutral/Friendly
* The Asylum - Neutral
* The Soviets - Neutral/Friendly

=== Phase I (The Akex Army): November 8th 2017 - December 2nd 2017 ===
YotoGamer was the first to join the server. He was like a &quot;leader&quot;. He was a good friend of GamerAddict, who was the founder and the leader. YotoGamer wanted to join Highland to get some good dupes but he did not have a microphone. GamerAddict wanted to &quot;make highlands and other groups go boom and make a big mark on the server&quot;. He made YotoGamer the &quot;founder&quot; of Akex to be undercover to spy Highland and to destroy them. YotoGamer only wanted dupes. He didnt like wars but he accepted the offer. GamerAddict called this &quot;Operation Downlands&quot;. GamerAddict said he will not be in 2b2t for a few months and gave ownership to YotoGamer and made YotoGamer, Pepper and ParanormalDoctor leaders. YotoGamer trolled Pepper giving him the lowest rank on the server and GamerAddict thought he could take advantage of this situation by telling Highland a lie in which YotoGamer stole the leadership of Akex and wanted to fight against Highland. He didnt want that, it was just a joke. Highland said Akex was a small group and they didnt care. GamerAddict told YotoGamer &quot;I just need a very small griefing team. I cant lead a army&quot; and he deleted the discord server. Quickly, YotoGamer spammed everyone the link to Unidad (the new Akex) and told everyone what GamerAddict really wanted.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;THIS IS A PLACEHOLDER NAME FOR THE ERA, IT IS NOT OFFICIAL UNTIL EVERYONE AGREES ON A NAME*

'''[[Timeline|Timeline of 2b2t]]'''

&lt;-- [[Grand Retard Period]]

--&gt; [[The Age of Rebirth|Age of Rebirth]]

The Unification Period is a period in which several large and small groups unified together on several occasions. One includes a formation to seek a better future for 2b. Another includes the formation of groups in the Sixth Incursion. The formations also caused the first form of &quot;slave labor&quot; on 2b in which newfags were forced into labor to create a mega obsidian wall, which was considered the largest community project in server history. The period is also know for several small powers rising and falling over the course of its existence, and has largely been defined by the large numbers of groups that have popped up during it. There was also a lot of activity and turmoil in this era such as group conflicts, the Incursion, and also an abundance of YouTubers logging on. The period came to an end with the [[Spawn Incursions|Sixth Incursion]] and [[jared2013]]'s &quot;31days31griefs,&quot; which destroyed most of the major bases on the server and lead to an age of &quot;Rebrith.&quot;

{{Infobox:_History|title1 = {{BASEPAGENAME}}|date = October 2017-June 2018|length = 9 months|player_rate = 85-300}}

== The Guild and the Asylum ==
On October 1st, 2017, well known player [[SmackAttack86]] created [[The Guild]]. The Guild was made in an attempt to unify players, create a place that everyone from any ethnicity, gender, or sexual preference could join and be welcomed at. It also encouraged people to join together and help collaborate on bases. A lot of players hated Smack though and The Guild was destroyed by [[The Highland]] soon after. However, this influenced many of Smack's enemies to band together and form huge groups such as [[The Asylum]].
== Veteran queue removal ==
in a reddit post, Hause announced, among other things, that [[Queue|veteran queue]] was going to be removed. This sparked outrage among oldfags and the server was jammed with bots in an attempt to kill it. The server queue was also removed for 24 hours (oldfags got triggered)
== Rise of Infrared and the Emperium ==
Since the beginning of 2018 the reformed Team Inferno (now [[Infrared]]) and the [[Emperium]] have been fighting, griefing and insiding each other since the beginning of 2018. This conflict originated when The Emperium had betrayed an initial alliance, taking down 5 large Inferno bases in a show of force. This was done purely because of how annoying the members in Inferno were. After about another week, Inferno reformed into Infrared and sided with VoCo during the VoPerium war. However, after about two weeks, almost nothing had been done to either side, causing VoCo and the Emperium to create a truce to better their relations. Infrared did not follow suit, instead remaining resentful of the Emperium. 

After the formation of the U.G.E., the amount of force opposing Infrared was simply too much for them to face alone. To counter the formation of this super alliance, Infrared helped create what they called the &quot;Alpha Alliance&quot; with Highland and the remnants of the Peacekeepers.

== The [[United Group Embassy|U.G.E]] and Alpha Alliance ==
The United Group Embassy (UGE) formed on January 10th of 2018 with over 15 groups coming together to build and communicate. As one of the major groups in the UGE, and the one that had created the discord, The Emperium was one of the most active member-groups during this early time. As a result, Infrared (who had been invited despite previous hostilities against several member-groups as it was believed they could put their differences aside to have fun and build) ordered the grief of the 1st physical Embassy base, which was carried out by IHackedWalmart. Some time passed, and after a few brief spawn skirmishes, the 3rd embassy base was leaked by Lotus of highland for very little reason. 

Infrared and Highland had a brief alliance with the goal of hunting down UGE bases and killing their members at spawn, but it did not last long, mainly due to their inability to do so. At one point, the Peacekeepers decided to rejoin the server (likely because of the temp map or some dupe) where they formed a triple alliance with Infrared and Highland and created a discord to talk together aside from the Infrared discord, the Alpha Alliance, a group dedicated to destroying Emperium and the rest of the UGE. Later on Team Virus and Team Rainbow also joined the alliance. AA never made any bases and would only do much at spawn together, however most of this was done in the Infrared discord. AA did it's best during all three tempmaps in late March to early April 2018 and the discord was very active. 

After the UGE started to fade away sometime in March 2018, AA started to fight the newly formed 6th incursion that began on April 3rd 2018. AA fell apart due to arguments between the leaders, one arguement in particular caused PandaSauce to leave the Alliance after a fight with FluffBuck3t, resulting in both Highland and the Peacekeepers splitting from AA, afterwards the whole thing collapsed. It ended with Retronaut kicking everyone from the discord and leaving too, afterwards the AA discord was only used to spam &quot;AA is cucked&quot; until it was eventually deleted. Highland, Infrared and Rainbow remained allies however shortly after this Highland betrayed Infrared. Leaving Infrared having to combat the 6th incursion by themselves, after the incursion the conflict died down between Infrared and Emperium with fights at spawn, insidng and griefing becoming less and less frequent. However this would change soon.... 

== March and April temp maps ==
During march and early April of 2018, several [[Temp Maps|temporary maps]] were created by [[Hausemaster]] for different reasons. The first was created early in March while the main map was being ported to new hardware, due to the current hardware being insufficient. Few events of significance occurred on this map, other than a lot of temporary bases being built all over the place.

The second temp map was the [[April Fools Maps|April fools map]], created on march 31st and ending on April 2nd. It was a customized world with terrain and ore generation radically different from the norm, and was initially about 1024 blocks wide before being shrunk to about 256 blocks wide. Ghasts and enderdragons were spawned, all the wood ran out, a bunch of players with diamond gear built a heavily fortified base in one of the top corners, and other typical April fool's map shenanigans ensued.

The third temp map was by far the most important, because it was made very soon after [[AntVenom]]'s video about 2b2t was released, and so the first wave of new players joined while this temp map was up. It was created for the same purpose as the one in march, because the new hardware was causing performance problems and hause needed to port the main map to yet another new SSD. Players from most of the existing factions banded together to establish an incursion base, Fort Dick, about 1500 blocks from spawn, and used it as their base of operations, while razing the spawn area of trees and bases and lavacasting it in the meantime.

== 31days31griefs Begins ==
Jared2013 begins the 31days31grief event, in which he griefs a base for every day of the month of May using various methods of acquiring coordinates. This causes widespread pandemonium as many players speculate there is a backdoor, however this likely was never true.

== AntVenom and the Sixth Incursion ==
When the main map returned, the [[Spawn Incursions|sixth incursion]] kicked into full gear, as the regular players now had full access to all of their [[Duplication Glitches|dupe]] stashes, [[Golden Apples|gapples]], [[Suicide Bombing (Crystal/Bed Bombing)|crystals]], maxed-out diamond stuff, and other such things. Most importantly of all, they had access to duped enderchests, which quickly became integral to the incursion's master plan. In order to more quickly convert these enderchests into eight times their volume worth of obsidian which would be needed for the project, &quot;gulags&quot; were built at spawn in both the [[The Overworld|overworld]] and the [[The Nether|nether]]. Any new players who found their way into these places were imprisoned, and forced to duel each other in gladiatorial combat, expand the gulags themselves, and, most importantly, mine enderchests, all under the penalty of death for noncompliance, and the lure of high-tier items as a reward for doing what they were told. Eventually, the project, an obisidian wall around spawn, each of the four walls a thousand blocks long and reaching the height limit, was completed. But immediately, many members of the incursion turned against it, now focusing their efforts on destroying the wall with withers. IHackdWindowsXP, [[Armorsmith]] and IHackedWalmart withered the northern wall the day after [[FitMC]] released his video on the wall, this resulted in the &quot;battle&quot; of the northern wall, in which the incursion outnumbered their enemy 20 to 1. This was one of the most notable sabotage attempts on the wall. For the remainder of the incursion's duration, the incursion members who remained loyal to the project defended it, but when the incursion ended a month after it began, the wall was left to crumble. Several large YouTuber logged in both during and after the Incursion, the most important being mega-YouTuber PopularMMO's, although he said he won't be making a video on the server.
== Post-Incursion events ==
The [[Spawn Incursions|incursion]] ended on May 3rd 2018, a month after it began. It is deemed a success.

[[FitMC]] released a video in early May which detailed events that had occurred about two years earlier, explaining how [[Hausemaster]] was complicit in the [[The Tyranny|Tyranny's]] [[Backdoors|backdooring]] of the server for over a year, and how they used their access to [[Georgebush420]]'s admin account to obtain unobtainable items such as [[Super Weapons|superweapons]] and [[Barrier Blocks|barriers]], enable and disable plugins at will, and obtain the coordinates of player's beds, which allowed them to find previously hidden bases and destroy them with withers, despite no one else being able to use withers. This caused a large portion of the playerbase to leave in the months leading up to [[TheCampingRusher|rusher]]'s invasion, resulting in the low server traffic that occurred at the time.

== Empire’s Edge Grief ==
The [[Emperium]]'s main base, Empire's Edge, was leaked, due to one of the members of the base betraying the Emperium, and it was subsequently griefed, and world downloads of it were made available. 

== The Boedecken's Grief ==
The Boedecken, a large base kept secret for nearly two years, is griefed. FitMC makes base tour shortly after. jared2013 did not claim responsibility for the base's greif. This caused Caines_Law and several others to begin investigating.The grief was initially blamed on Jared, who did not claim responsibility, but was later found out to be a former group member, Beardler. This initiated mass suspicions about [[the Museum]].[[Category:History]]

{{DISPLAYTITLE:United Group Embassy}}
 [[File:UGE_2b2t.png|thumb]]
The United Group Embassy was formed by over 10 groups on 2b2t in order to seek a more positive future.

{{2B2T_Group_Template|approx_founding_date = January 10th, 2018|status = Seperate (Each group working on their own projects)|#_of_members = 200+}}

==History==

The U.G.E. was first thought of by members of the Emperium and took the name &quot;The Embassy&quot;. This was around the time when the temp map on 2b2t was around. The idea was to bring all the largest groups and have them collaberate and cooperate in order to accomplish more impressive projects. It was a good idea in theory, but it mostly proved nonuseful and the discord server used was often not used. The idea was soon abandoned. 

At around January 5th, the idea was re-explored, and this time, took the name of &quot;The United Group Embassy&quot;. This group was a little different as well. It wasn't just meant for all the largest groups that made a noticable difference, it was for any group that was large enough to be able to be reached out to. 

It was going smoothly until the group know as &quot;Infrared&quot;, who has a hatred towards The Emperium, decided to destroy the first group build the U.G.E had made, known as the 1st Physical Embassy. This led to immediate expulsion from the U.G.E and a general hostility from all member groups towards Infrared 

With the creation of the 2nd Embassy, Highland leaders Lotus and FluffBuck3t joined the U.G.E. Previously highland had been represented by other Grand Masters. The 2nd Embassy was leaked by Sniper, as he believed Jared2013 had coordinates to a large group base he was a part of, and as a result he started giving Jared coordinates to slow him down. HouseHouseHouse1 arrived at the base, causing a general panic among members, who made the decision to destroy the base themselves. It was later found that HouseHouseHouse1 had been instructed by VoCo to not destroy the base, and as such the 2nd Embassy had been in little danger at that time. 

The 3rd Embassy was quickly started after the abandonment of the 2nd Embassy, with fewer, but more impressive builds. Only 4 days after the start of the 3rd Embassy, a sign was found at nether 0,0 by a U.G.E member group stating the coordinates of the Embassy. It was soon discovered that Lotus of highland had placed the sign there as a sort of &quot;revenge&quot; for making a dumb factionball emoji. Yes, the 3rd Embassy fell because Lotus didn't like an emoji. As a result of this Highland was quickly banned from the U.G.E. 

Currently the Embassy has 13 different groups, all combined having over 200 members. 

With the start of the 6th incursion, the U.G.E has become largely inactive, with each member group doing their own independent work. There are plans to re-unify the United Group Embassy, but they have not come to term yet. 

==Voting Format==

The U.G.E manages most of its decisions with a vote. There are 2 types of votes: Popular vote, and group votes. When a group joins the U.G.E a vote is held to give them full rights, after which point they will get a designated &quot;Voter&quot; role. This singular voter gets to cast their vote for the group during any important votes. This ensures that each and every group has an equal say on important decisions. These important votes are called &quot;Group votes&quot; because they involve each groups voter. The other type is Popular vote, in which anyone in the discord can vote with a thumbs up or thumbs down. This is usually for less important things, or for events. __NEWSECTIONLINK__

{{DEFAULTSORT:United Group Embassy}} 

== &quot;Battling&quot; with the &quot;Alpha Alliance&quot; ==
After the U.G.E. formed uniting over 10 groups for a common cause, Infrared and Highland felt the need to make their own form of alliance, which they call &quot;Alpha Alliance&quot;. Their largely negative and hostile view of the U.G.E. is due to their hatred for [[The Emperium]], saying that they believe the Emperium has grown too strong and needs to be stopped, and how the believe that the U.G.E. is simply an Emperium controlled group.

Due the Alpha Alliances (AA) negative view of the U.G.E, several fights have taken place, usually with 10+ people participating each time. With the disbandment of Asylum, a U.G.E member group, most fights have been unrelated to the UGE. Despite these battles, the U.G.E is primarily an event-based and building group.

[[File:2222 converted.png|thumb|220x220px|Valkyria Symbol]]
Valkyria was a powerful group from 2013 that was responsible for the first three[[ Spawn Incursions]] and had many bases around 2b2t. Its symbol was an obsidian bird of prey statue. They had many names such as the Valk group, Valkyrians, Assguardians, and the Incursion group but in the end, they were all the same thing. They were marked by having intimidating numbers and fully armed for pvp members as well as great builders/redstoners on their side. They dominated spawn for months on three occasions and built several of the biggest and most populated bases of the server. If you find an obsidian eagle somewhere, that means they were there. Valkyria group was basically a merging of small groups such as [[The Black Flag Group]] / Anatolia, [[Hitlerwood Basegroup]] , [[Legion of Shenandoah]] and [[Gape Basegroup]] .
[[File:Capture-1495840217.PNG|thumb|220x220px|Custom Flag]]

== History ==
[[File:Minecraft banner g1q1Dgy1ngv.png|thumb|240x240px|Valkyria Banner (Sato86's banner)]]
The group started when Drewbookman decided to expand the terrority of Anatolia and begin to base with new players. Many new base groups known as Anatolia (aka the Black Flag Group) and Hitlerwood fused to create Valkyria, a new base project, which became the name that people around the server began to refer to the group. Hitlerwood was recognized as the last [[facepunch]] base as the members were all facepunchers. Founders of Valk were Drewbookman, zxc. Members of it were Coldwave, Hinderjd, zach339, KnightVista and infiltrate. Pyrobyte, Drewbookman and Sato86 were the members of Anatolia.

The group had a lot of [[Facepunch Republic]] ideals and what prevented the group from being destroyed by anti-Facepunchers was [[Duplication Glitches|the 1.4.7 dupe]]. The 1.4.7 dupe is what gave Valkyria the power and supplies to become a formidable force on the server. The group began gaining new members as friends of friends wanted to join the Valkyria base project. Valkyria showed their dominance on the server in the first incursion, invading spawn and killing enemies and newfags. 

A few days after the first incursion, however, Valkyria was griefed due to Drewbookman, who was accused of a few fires in the base, frustration and disbelief with the group after many newfags who had been invited by coldwave and sato86 began killing and stealing from others. He used withers and tnt to deal severe damage to the newfag houses but was then killed by Hinderjd.

The group moved on from Valkyria and they showed their dominance once again in the [[Spawn Incursions|second incursion]] against newfags who came from an IGN article on 2b2t with Drewbookman, Pyrobyte, Dr.Cash, and Kinorana to lead the reigns. They also hired more members at spawn and built more bases.

The group fell for the first time when several Valkyrian bases, such as Asgard, got griefed before their completion by [[popbob]]. This made several members give up on the initiative and leave the group or quit the server entirely.
[[File:VgKeCIA.png|thumb|220x220px]]
However, Valkyria was revived by [[the Legion of Shenandoah]] and the [[Gape base group]], who both looked up to Valkyria and gladly welcomed the former members into their group. This lead to a new base project known as Fenrir. When 3b3t became the newmape for 2b2t in early 2015, the Valkyrians founded Nova. However, when the server was returned to the oldmape, Fenrir was completed. These bases gave Valkyria the life it needed as its numbers began to grow and they started to regain their power. Valhalla and Valkyria 2.0 were also being built.
[[File:6BeznZh.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Asgard II/Valkyria Flag]]

Valkyria decided to create Asgard II, in remembrance of the original, and the base was known to have housed one of the largest base groups in 2b2t. Valkyria membership began to grow more rapidly and the base became more and more magnificent. However, Asgard II did not last as the coords were publicly leaked in the spring of 2015 by Sato86 in an attempt to cover up internal affairs between him, james and xarviar. The leak caused several members to either flee, panic, or destroy parts of the base themselves in order to prevent others from claiming the glory of destroying Asgard.

Valkyria killed hundreds of players at spawn, both newfags and enemies of the group. During the outrage, Wrath Outpost, Volunteers Base, and several other spawn bases were built. The group specifically made Wrath completely out of obsidian to show how powerful Valkyria was due to how hard obsidian was to obtain (considering how massive the build was) and to show intimidation and fear due to the black color of obsidian. They decorated several other of their spawn bases with riches and valuables to show this powerfulness as well. [[Jared2013]] and [[Oremonger]] were amongst the enemies of Valkyria during the 3rd Incursion. The group dominated spawn for a month.

Once the Incursion ended, Valkyria began to disband. All the facepunch members had left 2b2t by this point and players began to move on from Valk which lead to its eventual dissolution.

[[File:2b2spawn2.jpg|thumb|221x221px|The Valley's location at spawn]]

== History ==
A long time ago (probably late 2010/2011), someone placed a cluster of furnaces not so far away from spawn and surrounded those furnaces with lava pillars and cobble monsters (which makes the valley of furnaces well known). No one knows how much coke the person must have sniffed to make this, but on thing is know for sure... it's near spawn, and it has alot of furnaces. The earliest description of the Valley we have is from THEJudgeHolden's comics.

In 2017 the valley was griefed by some unknown autist. PandaPimp decided to turn it into a valley of ender chests.

In early 2018 some unknown autist (Probably the same one from before) stole most of the furnaces and ender chests and put cobble swastikas everywhere.

[[File:CMIJ341.png|thumb|220x220px|Valley of Wheat Griefed]]

== History   ==
The Valley of Wheat was built by [[Jaang]], a player who did not really interact with other players, who was the sole builder of the entire sanctuary. He spent his entire time on 2b2t building and expanding the Valley in both of his phases from 2011-2012 and late 2013-2014. He let players take food from the valley but never allowed them to build in it.

During a trip through the Nether, Jaang was attacked by another player but was saved by [[Offtopia]], who was one of the only players that Jaang interacted with. Offtopia would give him gifts and would protect the Valley of Wheat, killing anyone if they did not replant the wheat. Offtopia also invited other known players like [[xcc2]], passie05, zxcwbz1, and others, who helped replant and remove any small griefings, such as lavacasts and TNT craters. Offtopia would continue to defend the Valley, with &quot;tooth and nail&quot; according to [[Fit]], up until the Rusher invasion.

The Valley of Wheat is one of the most respected builds on the server by almost all the oldfags. Even the notorious [[Popbob]] respected the Valley of Wheat as he did not grief it (despite killing Jaang). However, several players have griefed the valley. One of the most notorious griefs on the Valley of Wheat before the Rusher War was commited by an oldfag known as IMBJER. IMBJER was already a notorious griefer, making it his duty to grief every single building he found. When he griefed the valley he became one of the most hated players on the server at the time, increasing his notoriety further. The Valley was eventually restored by xcc2, Offtopia, and others. However, the griefs following IMBJER's grief caused Jaang to leave. Eventually, xcc2 and others left in early 2016, leaving Offtopia as the last, somewhat of a guardian. Despite these events, many other nonaligned players contributed to restoring the valley several times. 
[[File:IqKL6ke.png|thumb|220x220px]]

=== The Rusher War ===
During the events of the [[The Rusher War|Rusher War]], the Valley of Wheat was griefed a once again by the [[The Resistance|Resistance]], some [[Team Rusher]] members, and independent Rusher newfags. The griefing of the valley was a major event of the Rusher War as it escalated the Veteran frustration against the Rushers and pissed off several oldfags. The reason for the grief was because the Resistance wanted to become infamous and wanted to be on the Veteran kill list. During the war and after, the valley was restored by [[Team Aurora]], and several other nonpartisan players.

=== Present Day ===
Today, the Valley of Wheat is severely griefed due to people with [[11/11 Dupe|11/11 dupe]] items. Most of the original structures and wheat has been destroyed or covered with [[Lavacast|lavacasts]] and withers. There are still small spots of wheat remaining and some structures still perfectly intact but only on the outskirts of the valley. However, some people still return to the Valley of Wheat to repair portions of the damage. It is more griefed than ever as the days go on.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3361">== '''Vivec City''' ==

Vivec City is a base built by a sole anonymous player, it is based on a city from the game '''The Elder Scrolls : III Morrowind'''

A quote by the builder-

''&quot;Few players on 2b2t, oldfags or newfags, have heard of Vivec City. It is a base of beauty and peace, I started the build in March of 2016 and recently finished it. I think it is time to reveal it to the public. If you are smart enough to find it you deserve to enjoy my home.&quot;''

'''&lt;br /&gt;'''

== Background ==
A quote by the builder explaining the background-


''&quot;Have you ever played The Elder Scrolls 3 Morrowind? In the same series as TES 5 Skyrim, made by Bethesda Softworks who own Doom, Wolfenstein and the Fallout series, yeah you’ve heard of it. Anyway in Morrowind you could find a city called Vivec City or Vivec. It is one of my favourite places in all of video games and I decided to bring Vivec to Minecraft. Now I know I’m not the first to replicate a city from another game but I am the first to do it in 2b2t.&quot;''

== '''&lt;br /&gt;'''Layout, Buildings and Landmarks ==
In the main base there are nine islands, all fully furnished.

A quote by the builder-

&quot;''I first built nine Cantons (Islands) to begin with and then furnished them with houses, canals and populated the cantons with Citizens (Villagers) and Ordinators (Iron Golems). The blocks I used mostly consist of coloured concrete, stained clay and mushroom blocks. The main attraction of Vivec is the Baar Dau (look it up right now I promise). I put four Shulkers at the High Fane to levitate anyone up to Baar Dau. It is made completely of stone variants and contains my Armoury, Map Room, Shooting Range, Iron Farm and Chest Room. The other Cantons are all fully furnished and I have included the Canalworks, Underworks, Waistworks and of course the Gondolier.&quot;''

== '''&lt;br /&gt;'''Other Amenities ==
Vivec is furnished with all the things most good bases have.

A quote from the builder-

''&quot;I have also added a few necessities that most bases have, an Alchemy Tower (gold farm), Silt Strider ranch (semi-automatic horse breeder), Ash Yam farm (Wheat, Carrot and other farms). I also added a few TES landmarks like a miniature Red Mountain, a replica Numidium made mostly of gold,  and elytra launch towers.&quot;''

== '''&lt;br /&gt;'''Extra Info ==
Vivec used both the [[11/11 dupe]] and the [[Donkey dupe]].


A quote from the builder-

&quot;''The 11/11 Dupe and Donkey Dupe filled my stashes and allowed me to stockpile resources. Thanks to these dupes I have fifty double chests full of gapples, enough sets of perfect armor to fill thirty double chests and other useful items. I have also obtained a large number of barrier blocks, bedrock and pig spawners although thanks to the “disable item” plugin they are unusable.&quot;''

Vivec is open to new visitors.

Another quote by the builder-

&quot;''Pack your shulkers, press F3 and set off to Vivec. Come without sword, bow or crystal. Come home, come to Morrowind.&quot;''

== Statistics ==

Player Count : 1 permanent member usually 1 visitor per week.

Resources : Almost unlimited, mostly building blocks but lots of armour and weapons.

Location : Not for public eyes. (Although some say it is in the +,+ quadrant)

Protections : One guy with perfect gear and some hacked clients

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1036">x420 y69 z911, commonly referred to as 420 911, is the official [http://2b2t.wikia.com/wiki/The_Vortex_Coalition Vortex Coalition] [[spawnbases|spawn base]] .

For over a year, the spawn base was simply a meeting point made of lavacast to defer griefers, and was continually griefed and rebuilt since it was founded in June 2015. After [[Donkey Dupe|the dupe glitch of 1.11]] , the area was terraformed and constructed into an obsidian megastructure.

Some groups have attempted to grief 420 911, but their attempts prove to be insufficient and trivial. The Vortex Coalition has a dedicated team that continually rebuilds the spawn base. All griefs were gettong repaired within hours.

[[File:2016-12-07 12.51.30.png|thumb|530x530px]]

Even after griefers had spent hours severely withering the structure, it is still recognizable as a permanent mark on spawn.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="487">The Wife-Beater meme is a meme directed to [[OreMonger]]. The meme goes that apparently OreMonger is a wife-beater in real life. This is obviously not true but people wanted to piss off Ore anyways.

== Behind the Meme ==
The meme first started out when popbob commented in 2014 that OreMonger was a wife beater in real life. People since then have been calling him one because of the comment made by popbob as the general population of 2b didn't really like OreMonger.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3768">Existed in 2016 (October) Griefed sometime in March of 2017

[[Wintermelon]] was a base built by [[Toshie]] with dedication filled with sweat, shit, and tears, but mostly shit. It is deemed by many as a [https://imgur.com/gallery/GvpRw majestic] base. Before we get into how [[Wintermelon]] was griefed, lets see it's beginnings... {{2B2T_Build_Template|title1 = Wintermelon|status = Destroyed|approx_date_construction_began = Sometime in October|leaker = DeadlyDarkDragon|approx_date_demolished = March 16th, 2017|demolishers = The 4th Reich|realm = Overworld|coordinates = X: 73,429 Y: 64 Z: -145,644|players_who_live(d)_here = Toshie, theloneloner, Fuffer, Vaxent,  jddinger, Goldensock Offtopia, MrChoCho, Aaron_Alvin, Tanaxis, Jumbo_Warrior, and several more|builder(s) = Toshie, Parthicus, Vaxent, http_logan, DeadlyDarkDragon, MrChoCho, Jumbo_Warrior, iTavux, Aaron_Alvin, Frostraver.|image1 = 2017-03-11 02.40.33.png}}

==Humble Beginnings==
After the Rusher War, [[Wintermelon]] was founded by [[Toshie]] and [[Vaxent]]. They had initially based at [[Acacia]] (The City of [[Melons]]) but after the explosion of the Rushers, it soon became apparent that the base was no longer safe, it being so close to spawn. 

Wintermelon started out as a modest tower build and an expansive underground storage area, but Toshie had even more on his mind. Soon after the fall of [[Acacia]], [[theloneloner]] and [[Fuffer]] joined [[Toshie]] and [[Vaxent]]. They also encountered [[aaron_alvin]] on the nether highway, and ended up inviting him to the base as well. They would cautiously invite both new and old fags to Wintermelon. 

[[MrChoCho_]] raised Wintermelon's power even further when he personally discovered the drop dupe ([[11/11 Dupe]]). No one knows if the dupe was known by anyone else before MrChoCho_ discovered it, ''but'' &quot;They had it for an entire month, before it became public&quot; according to [[Fit]], through a youtube video he made of his tour through the city titled: MINECRAFT'S MOST MAJESTIC BASE (2b2t.org).
==The Fall of Wintermelon==
After the series of dupes that happened in the winter of 2016, a lot of the basemates got bored and became inactive. [[Toshie]] continued to try keeping Wintermelon alive but just like most (if not all) bases on 2b2t, the coords were leaked by DeadlyDarkDragon due to sheer boredom. The players at Wintermelon were given a warning by [[jddinger]], who was told by [[Sun_Wukon]], a 4th kike, that the Reich was coming and [[the 4th Reich]] blew the place to smithereens, along with a battle that took place with over 16 players. This was the last organized event that the Reich has done before most members joined the [[Spawn Masons]] that month. Afterwards, the group went on to found another base together, [[Summermelon]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2602">World downloads are copies of a base, build or other 2b2t location which have been downloaded and converted to single player world files via the use of [[Hacked Clients|hacked clients]] or the World Download Mod, which, similar to Optifine, works on Multiplayer servers. World downloads have a wide variety of uses and are a popular [[Trade|trading]] commodity among the 2b2t community.

== Uses ==
As world downloads allow a base to be preserved, they enable a base to be explored even after its destruction on the main server. This is the core idea of [[Project Vault]], which contains many world downloads of famous bases in their prime throughout 2b2t's history. With the coming of [[the Rusher War]], the demand for Project Vault and world downloads increased. Players today are constantly looking and advertising world downloads, either for personal viewing, or for other projects similar to Vault. Since Vault has been taking too long to go public and the desire to see 2b's greatest builds has grown tremendously due to the influx of players from [[the Rusher War]], it was beaten by [[the Museum]] in terms of going public. Many players release world downloads of their bases on the [[Subreddit|2b2t subreddit]], usually after importing it into worldedit to remove the coordinates as well as nullifying any [[Coordinate Exploits|coordinate exploits]]. 

== List of world downloads ==
While links to world downloads can be found on their respectice articles, I decided to archive them all here as well (please expand if you find more)

From Lifeisgood73's dump (none or little to none of those were built or saved as downloads by him, but the list is copypasted from his subreddit post):

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1344">The world-famous spawn base, formerly called [[HermeticLock]] 's World Famous Spawn Base, was a movement/project that started in February of 2017 by HermeticLock, one of the [[DonFuer]] 's highest members. It was created as a social experiment, decidedly, Hermeticlock would continue to build there no matter how bad the griefing got, As such, the coords were made public. Of course, as a spawn base, this was griefed pretty easily, and a few days after its construction, [[The Third Largest Battle in 2b2t History]] (15 players) occurred in the spawnbase, with some players helping HermeticLock rebuild the spawn base.

The coords have been publicly leaked by HermeticLock: -3100 -2750

== Events ==
Although the base itself seems nothing special, HermeticLock planned to keep rebuilding the base, no matter how many times people would try to grief it.

== Legacy ==
The spawn base is currently one of the most popular battlegrounds in 2b2t, to the point where even [[Fit]] has visited the spawn base several times. 

== Timeline ==
* February 6, 2017 - Spawnbase built
* February 9, 2017 - Third Largest Battle of 2b2t History, with HermeticLock and his group trying to defend and rebuild the spawn base.
* February 12, 2017 - [[Subreddit]] Post
* July 2017 - Made active once again.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2519">The Wrath Outpost is a monument that was built during the Third Spawn Incursion by [[Valkyria]] . Wrath was the central spawn base of the [[Valkyria|Valkyrians]] during the [[Spawn Incursions|Incursion]] . It was given the name Wrath as a symbol of Valkyria's rage towards the other players for the destruction of [[Asgard II]] . The Wrath outpost was made completely out of obsidian, making it relatively ungreifable (Although people have been able to lava cast and wither it). Inside of Wrath Outpost was two pieces of bedrock placed by [[Pyrobyte]] due to his access to a [[Backdoors|backdoor]], one in the staircase, and the other in the center.

{{Space_Valkyria|built = May 2nd - May 16th, 2015|destroyed = November 3rd, 2016 (largest grief)|builder = Valkyrians|griefer = 4th Reich, several others|dimension = Overworld (Coords: X: -980 Y: 79 Z: -532)|builder(s) = Valkyrians|griefer(s) = 4th Reich, several others|coordinates = X: -980 Y: 79 Z: -532}}

== Architecture ==
Wrath Outpost's entrance is a long wide corridor that leads into the heart of the building. The heart of the Outpost has a simple square perimeter, but the walls are made of giant arches that form into a large dome that goes above the clouds.

== Griefing ==
After [[the Rusher War]] , [[The 4th Reich]] posted a video on their Youtube channel. The video showed them griefing Wrath Outpost by spawning many withers as well as removing the bedrock placed by [[Pyrobyte]] using a method involving a dragon egg.

&quot;Ruins of Wrath&quot;
[[File:2017-12-26 10.32.49.png|thumb|220x220px|Interior of Wrath after being greifed several times, circa October 2017. ]]
By FlameEyeGamer

&quot;Ruins of Wrath,

Covered in Black,

A shroud of grey,

along your back,

Your walls dark as the void,

'tis a shame you're destroyed,

Heartless made,

Heartless came,

Heartless went,

And made it lame,

You came to us in our plight,

Now you stand a beacon of light.&quot;

== Repairs ==
A group known as [[Imperia]] attempted to fix the Wrath Outpost during the [[11/11 dupe]] , but gave up due to interruptions caused by [[the Fifth Incursion]] . [[BabbaJ]] said he may also try to repair Wrath, even though he was a part of the grief.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3550">&quot;X has been disabled due to an exploit&quot; is a popular [[Memes|meme]] in the [[2b2t]] community. It parodies the efforts of [[Hausemaster]]/[[Curtis]]'s attempts to patch game breaking exploits by disabling certain gameplay features such as certain items. The meme itself is thought to have originated from Hause disabling elytras due to the elytra exploit. The meme has pretty much become formally recognized even by the admins themselves as they have incorporated the meme into the server MOTDs.

== Examples ==
* Lightning has been disabled due to an exploit - Done in order to nullify [[popbob]]'s thunder hack which gave him unprecedented power to hunt down and grief players bases, including [[Fit]] at one point. When thunder was reenabled in late 2016, it understandably caused a panic as many people feared that the thunder hack could once again be used to locate bases.
* [[The Nether|Nether roof]] has been disabled due to an exploit - Attempting to go above y128 in the nether will teleport you back down. This was done to prevent people easily lagging the server by generating chunks as they could easily autowalk millions of blocks due to the completely flat bedrock ceiling.
* [[Super Weapons|Super weapons]] have been disabled due to an exploit - Hausemaster installed a plugin which reset the stats of the 32k super weapons as they were created using a backdoor.
* Elytras are disabled due to an exploit - The original meme and the exact wording of the text on the tab screen. Was done to prevent lag caused by mass chunk generation as there was an exploit enabling infinite elytra flight. This disabling directly led to the construction of [[Toro's Theater]] as [[Torogadude]] needed something else to build as he was unable to fly back to the [[Death Star II]].
* Bedrock has been disabled due to an exploit - While many old players still own bedrock from much ealier exploits, recent plugins mean any bedrock which is placed in someone's inventory is instantly deleted. To get around this, players begun using hoppers to remove bedrock from their old stashes into shulker boxes for transportation.
* [[Map Art|Maps]] have been disabled due to an exploit - Not exactly, as the exploit itself was what disabled them rather than Hause. For more infomation, see [[Kinorana Map Crisis]].
* [[Hacked Items|Illegal items]] have been disabled due to an exploit - Following the upgrade to 1.12, Hause announced a [https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t/comments/6p4c24/the_surprise_that_might_cause_a_shitstorm/ &quot;suprise that might cause a shitstorm&quot;] on the [[subreddit]]. That suprise was the attempted removal of all [[Hacked Items|illegal items]]. This was an extremely controversial change (it did indeed cause a shitstorm) as many rare and valuable items unique to 2b2t such as stacked armor and player heads were removed. This patch also attempted to remove illegal pig spawners but then players started reporting that naturally generated spawners had mysteriously disappeared, rendering many mob grinders useless

== Message Of The Days ==
* Walking is temporarily disabled due to an exploit
* Crafting is disabled due to an exploit
* memes were disabled due to an exploit

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="443">Xarviar is an oldfag 2b2t who joined early 2011, spent his time flitting between very well known bases such as [[Snacky's Library]] , [[The Lands]] , [[Valkyria]] , [[Fenrir]] , [[Asgard II]] , [[Olympus]] , [[KGB]] , and more. While xarviar has spent most of his time basing with many well known oldfags and midfags, he himself has no noticeable achievements to his name as he rarely griefs or builds.

This has been taken from a reddit post and written by xcc2 himself. If you want to read the reddit post, you can find the post [https://redd.it/55ttyh here]

Disclaimer: This is a long post, and there is no tl;dr. This is history; read it, or don't. There are a lot of images. Also, please excuse the rambling nature of this writing; the events span about four years of activity beginning almost 6 years ago, and I'm pretty much remembering as I go along.

Xcc2 himself said that he had not died since 2012 after meeting with  __TheAndrey__ on the +x highway who did not attack him

This tale begins at the dawn of 2b2t and my first days of adventuring on the minecraft anarchy map that has not been reset since approximately November 2010. I came to know about 2b2t.net through a post on 4chan early in 2011.

At this time there were several daily posts on 4chan either on /b/ or /v/ that would draw 50-100+ players to 2b2t during busy times of the day. I'm honestly not sure when I first logged onto the server, but my earliest screenshots date back to Beta 1.2 which came out in January 2011. I was not much of a minecraft player, having only played in singleplayer survival mode during an early alpha release. I happened to join the server during one of the busiest times and spawn was filled with dozens of people punching eachother to death with their fists. At that time new players spawned at 0,0 and there was an obsidian area on the ground approximately 15x15 blocks square. It was impossible to place any blocks on this slab or build ontop of it. It was usually surrounded by a curtain of lava or water or cobble that had to be navigated to escape.

[https://i.imgur.com/g5AlgdE.png Early Spawn - 2011]

This does not show the original obsidian slab that I spawned on. 0,0 is located in the upper right of this render, just in front of the stone ridge. Spawn looked somewhat like this for a few years, with house occassionally removing water or lava that caused lag, or even flattening spawn to remove tall structures. The big wall and PEACE sign in the distance as well as the road out of spawn at 42Z drew me to the -X direction. These iconic structures stayed a part of the 2b2t map from the time of my joining until late in 2013.

After adventuring for a few weeks and staying in various ruined structures I stumbled upon a partially destroyed castle which I believed to be abandoned. There were no people around and it was (at that time) reasonably far from spawn, located at approximately -400, 800. The castle was made up of four towers connected by walls with a central courtyard. One of the towers was built almost to sky height (128) and had a room ontop of it. In the courtyard I found some small buildings against the inside wall with signs named for players inhabiting them. One of the names that I remember was 'Pimpmastaflex'. I don't know if he was the original builder of this castle, but he was part of the group of [[Facepunch]] users that made up most of the dedicated player base of 2b2t at that time (sequel, chezhead, Phagocitic, etc). The Facepunch players had a long history of creating bases and posting the coords on the forum only for them to be found and destroyed. This could have been one of their early builds.

[https://i.imgur.com/ciIElPr.png The earliest version of this castle had no gatehouse]

I decided that I would repair the castle and make it my home. It was built all of cobble and easy to fix. After a few days there, I began to notice that other parts of the castle were being repaired, and someone had even created a house nearby.

[https://i.imgur.com/JWtnWDd.png alex02028's house]

Eventually I would meet [[alex02028]] and we agreed to continue to build and expand the area around this castle. I built the base's iconic aquaduct and shortly after I constructed the drum tower and arched twin towers. The top of the towers were made of red wool that was produced by dying white wool blocks with roses. Roses were obtained by flying around the surrounding areas and collecting all the red flowers I could find. To produce that much red wool was a massive challenge at the time (sheep could not be bred or dyed yet).

[https://i.imgur.com/xVfj4oK.png Early NFE]

By now several months had passed and more people began to become aware of this base. I offered food and shelter to new players joining the server who were trying to get a start, and I kept trees planted around the castle, asking only that players replant when they harvested wood. At the time the only tree in the game was oak. Many friendly players showed up and some offered to stay around and build things; others showed up during times that I wasn't there and I experienced my first taste of griefing on 2b2t. The griefing took many forms, some much more creative than others. One player offered to stay and build at the base, but instead created the first lavacast I had ever seen, right in front of the castle. He though it was funny, so I waited until he logged out (ontop of the cast) and I quickly took it down. When he next logged in, he fell from his logout height and died right in front of me, blaming me for his death. I took his gear, and used the cobble from the lavacast to construct the gatehouse on the front of the castle.

One group of griefers was known as &quot;[[Dark Carnival]] &quot;. After griefing they would always leave a sign with their name on it, and the words &quot;HONK HONK HONK&quot;. I don't know who any of the individual members were, I only saw their handiwork. They were gentle griefers, usually producing something obscene and taking some items from chests. One of their projects was to create a large pink wool penis in the castle's top tower room with white wool semen running down the side of the tower. True artists.

Somewhere around this time, while flying was allowed on the server, some players showed up and we had a battle in the skies over the base. This was my first meeting of [[Cold_Storage77]] and [[x0XP]] . Eventually I would become friends with both of them, and x0XP gave the base it's name: [[NFE]] . Named for the corrdiates that it occupied (N)egative (F)ourHundred, (E)ightHundred.

Griefing at NFE became somewhat of a sport, and there were various methods and levels of destruction over the years. Filling the courtyard with water, removing all the torches, covering the tower with lava or water, blasting parts with TNT, chipping down a tower, burning buildings and trees, etc.

[https://i.imgur.com/a5PeoeO.png Early Griefing of NFE]

The worst of the griefers was a group from Finland that called themselves [[Pyylaandia]] . The members were Fenster, Poersijn, Vaquera and their leader, Arthur_McGuire. These guys made it their mission to completely destroy the entire place... and they succeeded. One day I logged out in the castle, as usual; when I logged back in later I was met with utter destruction. There was not a single stone left of the castle and all that remained with a giant hole. The team from Finland had brought four inventories of TNT and decimated the place. I didn't know at the time how they had obtained so much TNT. There was no available dupe methods and in fact nobody had ever considered the possibility to dupe anything. At this point it was too much for my friend alex0208 and he left 2b2t. I saw him log on one or two more times over the years, but we never based together again, and I don't think he ever played on the server much after that.

With nothing left for me at NFE I eventually left and went to a new base with someone I had met named [[passie05]] . We would go on to build together at [[Squidbase]] , [[Plugin Town]] , [[Ziggy Town|Ziggybase]] and several other famous places together.

Over the months I would eventually return to NFE when one of the other bases I was at fell, and it would be completely repaired. The various friends of NFE that I met over the years would usually assist me. &lt;em&gt;Aaron&lt;/em&gt;, Fisky, policemike55, JDW9966, x0XP, Ziggy_S, Spikain, Leonnorius, livelion, CytotoxicTcell and many others. Some people even showed up when I wasn't there and performed their own rebuilds or repairs, and contributed by building their own buildings. toobin built his church, Ziggy_S made the farms below NFE, drheavy created his obsidian egg tower, [[Sato]] built the Valkyrian embassy and a player from the Broville server even made a house. Sometimes I would get a message from someone I knew telling me to come to NFE. I would arrive, and find it completely repaired.

[https://i.imgur.com/O3xT1Gf.png Signs from various visitors]

I would spend months there, guarding and repairing the base after each grief, usually none as bad as the one performed by the Pyyland team. These guys would be gone from 2b2t for months, and then show up randomly just to TNT the base into rubble again. They did this three different times until one day when I was talking to policemike55 I mentioned that they must be grinding gunpowder somewhere nearby, since I was seeing them online a lot. He told me that he thought he found a grinder a few thousand blocks away and he went looking for it. On that day polimike55 found the grinder and the guys from Pyyland AFK while it collected gunpowder. I met him there and we killed them all and TNTd their grinder, stopping them from their final grief of NFE.

Other notorious griefers did their work at NFE over the years. Harblax and Uzify were two players who constantly harassed me at NFE. During one exchange while NFE was in it's ICE phase Harblax and popbob had an epic battle on the ice with speed hacks right in front of the twin arched towers. As Harblax and popbob ran off into the distance and battled, I stayed and fought Uzify. I remember him running away back towards spawn after his armor broke, and I launched a single arrow at him from about 50 blocks away. The long arch of the arrow found it's mark as he ran and Uzify died on the ice. popbob would waver between being a friend of mine (and NFE) and it's enemy. One day I logged in and found popbob at NFE on one of his alts, creating a huge lavacast over the castle. For months he claimed that it was not him doing it, but someone else with access to the alt.

With new versions of minecraft came strange new problems to the map. Different terrain generation, the rising of the oceans and even a seed change that went unnoticed by [[Hausemaster|house]] for several weeks. This caused many of the strange phenomena that can be seen at various parts of the map, and also explains why some of the terrain generated in Amidst doesn't match what is found on the server. At some times NFE was in a tundra biome and the oceans were frozen.

NFE was home to 2b2t's first operating END portal which I constructed out of end frame blocks produced during the first backdoor hack of the server. policemike55 and some others had tried to create a portal weeks earlier but they were unaware of the correct eye of ender orientation requirements. With polimike55 present I lit the END portal in a special room I contructed under NFE to look exactly like a real stronghold END portal room:

[https://i.imgur.com/V1vz5Sn.png 2b2t's first functioning END portal]

[https://i.imgur.com/mBzrghG.png One of my alts at the END portal]

policemike55 and I were the first to enter the END and generate the original the_end map on 2b2t. Later that day JDW99666 and I slew 2b2t's first END dragon. Ultimately many more portals were created on the server with hacked end frames and House became aware of this. He removed all the portals he could find, and even removed all of the endstone blocks brought back to the overworld by using WorldGuard. The current END map is the second one to be created after House built his own END portals and allowed access officially.                                                                                                                                                       Here are some render of various incarnations of NFE:                                                                           

[https://i.imgur.com/04HfoPN.png Frozen NFE during a time when the world seed was different]                                                                 

[https://i.imgur.com/AALqr1z.png NFE rebuilt with a strange tower after a griefing sometime in 2012]

Ultimately I grew tired of doing repairs, and the griefing got too intense. With the new world height of 256 the lavacasts grew too large. Dozens of withers were released under NFE and the entire underground which had housed crops, animals, horses, and rooms dating back to 2012, were completely carved away. I lost interest in repairing NFE and completely abandoned it after it's last griefing. The base fell for a final time in January 2014.

[https://i.imgur.com/DWmW2EU.png Final griefing of NFE]

Today the devastation from spawn stretches all the to NFE and beyond. Parts of NFE are still recognizable.

[https://i.imgur.com/hugoXD0.png Today's Devastation]

I still consider NFE to be hallowed ground and I in the spirite of the base I sometimes roam it's grounds and will hand out supplies and gear to new travelers who find their way there. Maybe our paths will cross on 2b2t some time. I will most likely not be friendly to you unless I happen to find you amidst these ruins

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2889">Yiffington I was a base founded by[[ DemonElite119]] directly after the end of the [[Spawn Incursions|Third Incursion]] . WIP {{Space_Valkyria|title1 = Yiffington I|coordinates = X: -12,500 Z: 10,000|built = May 28, 2015|destroyed = November 14, 2015|builder = DemonElite119|griefer = jared2013|dimension = Overworld|builder(s) = DemonElite119|griefer(s) = jared2013}}

Taken to an undisclosed location by [[Sato86]], he was led to a small base he had occupied with 
[[File:YiffingtonImrx.png|thumb|180x180px|Picture Taken Pre-Grief by mrx]]
other individuals. After gathering supplies he had walked for some time, settling down just a mere 1,200 blocks away from what is known as the [[Dark Souls Castle|Dark Souls Base]].
[[File:2015-05-26_21.01.52.png|thumb|left|First thing built at Yiffington I]]Setting up in corrupted chunks, it was at first nothing but hills and some patches of flat land. Over time, he flattened the land, created artificial barriers, docks, and other artifical land features. Other structures were planned to be included, such as an underground city. [[File:2015-10-24_18.35.00.png|thumb|left|One of two icons featured at DemonElite119's bases. The Wolf Guardians.]]

During the construction of the base, he had invited numerous individuals such as [[IamTUNA]] , [[24]] , [[coconut4]], and [[jared2013]]. Before these individuals were invited, or arrived most of the base was already highly developed with the aforementioned features, decorative houses, and a very rudimentary mob grinder. When IamTUNA arrived, he set up a more efficient double grinder and began work on a tower wheat farm, that was ultimately uncompleted.
[[File:2b2t-Fit visits Yiffington I|thumb|330x330px]]
The base had been visited by a number of individuals, newfags and oldfags alike, and was largely ungriefed until jared2013 took it upon himself to destroy the base for reasons unknown (his reasons wildly differ every time he's asked). Initially, he blamed the user ashnwill, however Jared's trechary was soon revealed.[[File:2015-11-14_22.37.19.png|thumb|Yiffington I, post-grief]]

Willing to work past this issue with Jared, DemonElite and IamTUNA opted to start a new base called Yiffington II located at a nearby triple grinder and underground water temple, however personality clashes between DemonElite119 and Jared (usually threats by Jared) resulted in DemonElite giving the player [[SilverKrownKing]] coordinates to the new location so that he could turn the base into a crater. The reason for giving SilverKrownKing coordinates was also fueled by the revalation that despite Jared's behavior and dissolution of their group, Jared had only disabled, not destroyed the mob spawners as he claimed and it was evident Jared would return to use the mob grinder.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1824">Ziggy Town was a base built sometime in 2012. The base is best known for its giant bedrock comet which was built using Popbob's backdoor, which allowed hacked in infinite sources of bedrock. It was one of many bases that had the signature &quot;town&quot; in its name, as bases back then were generally called towns. The town can be downloaded [https://mega.nz/#!iZhg3RgR!0hSwOW-TUyp8KyCRu6bLNfvfmAX9XQb_3-aUNioHYco here ( superflat world)]

== History ==
The base was founded by [[passie05]] and [[ofc_ziggy_s|ziggy_s]] . It was the second town base that passie participated in, the first being his own, [[Passie Town]]. The wither in the bedrock spire was added some time later, and eventually killed by [[the 4th Reich]] in late 2016. 

== Architecture ==
The base is comprised of your standard minecraft castles and houses. It was more colorful than passie town due to the fact that the base was built in a different minecraft update, introducing new creative blocks that players could use.

The famous bedrock comet is actually one of the last bedrock, if not the last, builds still standing as [[Hausemaster]] has removed several illegal builds and lag machines over the years. The comet is actually not a comet, but is actually based off of a beacon from the Dead Space franchise.[[File:JXs0H4z.jpg|thumb|220x220px]]{{Space_Valkyria|title1 = Ziggy Town|built = Sometime in 2012|coordinates = X: -3,378 Y: 64 Z: 6,658|destroyed = Main lavacast made by jared2013, as well as other random players|builder = |griefer =jared2013 and others |dimension = Overworld|builder(s) = xcc2, passie05, PollyTheParrot, x0xp, ziggy_s|griefer(s) = jared2013 as well as random raiders, looters, and explorers}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2088">Zirilzuntir was a base founded on September 6th 2017 by Doctrzombie the base was mainly an underground base. The base was home to many players such as Doctrzombie, 0xymoron, mmmmbeefy, Shaihulid, SilverXSnake, Crazyguy_123, Waaiayki, Wuzaam, Slappinbadkids, McNeo, wierdguy, MorbidRain, and a few more members I cant remember all of them another player who sadly didn't make it there was rocksdrew.

The base had been peaceful for months until McNeo was angered by an accidental destruction of a shulker of stacked picks Crazyguy had apologized for his actions McNeo left the base and the ordeal was settled. The base then sat peacefully once again until the temp map and Ant invasion where many of the dwarves of ziril and Docs fans built an outpost named Fort Dick we fought the Ants until the last day of the temp map when Doctrzombie complained to the incursion members to stop killing us at the fort we were also for the incursion against Ants McNeo accused us of safekeeping Ants which we were not and he ended up nuking Fort Dick he then became angered by a player chatting with him and threatened to leak Zirils coords he continued to threaten members with the possible leaking of coords.

Once the main map came back I knew time was limited on the base I took screenshots and packed some items up to move them to a secret nearby stash I then killed back to spawn to kill Ants. 

On April 14th 2018 Zirils coords had been leaked by McNeo after an argument with one of Doc's discord mods around five hours later the base was griefed by its builders Morbidrain, Wierdguy, SilverXSnake, and Crazyguy_123. We the builders thought that we would be separated but about 1 month later most of use got invited to a new base together. I had gone back to Ziril about a month later to see the base was restored but I was saddened by this I had left signs saying to leave the base in its ruins and to let the dead rest. The saga of Ziril has ended but the Dwarves still live on.
